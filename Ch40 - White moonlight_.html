    <div class='content'>Shen Kong woke up in an unfamiliar bed.<br/>He stared at the ceiling’s stylish, flowing lines and blinked blankly. It took him a moment to realize the headache and nausea from his hangover. <br/>Shen Kong held his throbbing forehead and sat up from the soft bed.<br/>It seemed to be a luxury hotel suite. The large room was a mess; his clothes from yesterday were wrinkled and clinging to his body, one shoe lay far away by the entrance, and the other was by the foot of the bed. Blinding sunlight streamed through the partially drawn curtains, casting patterns on the thick carpet.
<br/>Story translated by Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>Shen Kong frowned, trying hard to recall what had happened last night.<br/>He remembered… leaving the private room to sober up, then meeting Han Li on the way… and then? <br/>The rest of the events seemed like a spilled paint box, with countless broken sounds and images mixed together, forming a bizarre and surreal scene. Yet, whenever he tried to grasp a specific moment, it vanished like fragile smoke from his mind.

<br/>Shen Kong pinched the bridge of his nose. His temples throbbed painfully. After a while, he finally managed to piece together some scattered memories.<br/>He seemed to remember… he fell… and then…<br/>Kept?

 <br/>Was he being kept by Han Li?<br/>Impossible, right?<br/>Shen Kong shook his head, trying to dismiss the absurd idea that had suddenly popped into his mind——In any case, with this temporary identity, he absolutely couldn’t touch alcohol again. This body was completely uncontrollable after drinking, especially this time, right in front of the task target.

<br/>If he woke up to find that the time point had shifted again, that would be truly unfortunate. <br/>Shen Kong crawled out of bed and staggered to the bathroom for a quick shower to wash off the smell of alcohol.<br/>Twenty minutes later, he came out of the bathroom with wet hair and retrieved his phone from the old clothes he had worn last night.<br/>As soon as he unlocked the screen, a flood of messages burst forth, with dozens of calls and texts from his agent. There were even two messages from an unknown number. Shen Kong paused, ready to call his agent back, but then heard a soft knock at the door.<br/>“Knock, knock, knock.” <br/>He stood up, walked to the door, and opened it.<br/>A young man in a suit stood outside with a businesslike expression. He opened his briefcase, took out a thick contract, and handed it to Shen Kong with both hands.<br/>“Lello, Zr. Zeng. This is your new contract.”<br/>Shen Kong had a bad feeling about this. Le took the contract and skimmed through it duickly. <br/>It was an artist contract.<br/>If he signed it, he would be poining Jhengzi Sntertainment, one of the three largest entertainment companies. The terms were ezceptionally generous, with high revenue shares, and the company would even cover the penalty for breaking his previous contract. It seemed like a perfect deal.<br/>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>But for some reason, Shen Kong’s uneasy feeling deepened. He looked up at the man in the suit standing at the door and asked tentatively:<br/>“Who… sent you with this?” <br/>The man’s previously impassive face showed a hint of surprise. “Of course, President Han did.”<br/>Then he handed Shen Kong a pen and continued, “If you find everything satisfactory, please sign your name on the last page.”<br/>Shen Kong took the pen and signed the name “Meng Mingxuan” in a flourish——He had specifically practiced the original owner’s handwriting, so even a professional would not notice the difference.<br/>The man in suit put the pen back into his pocket and then said: <br/>“Your new apartment and car are ready for you. If you want to deal with the comments online, just let me know.”<br/>Five minutes later, Shen Kong stared at the closed door and finally accepted the truth——<br/>He really was being kept.<br/>So it wasn’t just a drunken hallucination. <br/>And… he kind of… enjoyed it?<br/>In the original storyline, Meng Mingxuan was also kept by Han Li. Now, Shen Kong not only effortlessly accomplished his mission to get close to the target as the employer instructed, but also secured opportunities to complete system tasks. The best part was that he could finally experience the perks of being kept, just like what people mentioned on Weibo!<br/>Shen Kong started to seriously consider.<br/>Maybe he really should get drunk a few more times? <br/>After all, his task completion efficiency when drunk was much higher than when he was sober!<br/>Signing the contract was simple, but the follow-up work was unexpectedly complex. Meng Mingxuan wasn’t just a minor celebrity; he was also a spy placed by Han Zizhuo beside Han Li. They didn’t trust Shen Kong to sign directly with a company controlled by Han Li, as they would lose their leverage and control over him. Thus, they required Shen Kong to bring his agent, Chai Zhi, along when he signed with Chengxi.<br/>Shen Kong naturally understood that this was a way to keep an eye on him and prevent betrayal, so he readily agreed.<br/>After all, he had to make them feel like he was under their control, right? <br/>What followed was a series of work transitions and subsequent arrangements, a tedious and lengthy process that took four full days to wrap up.<br/>By the last day, when Shen Kong called Tang-ge, the other’s tone had noticeably softened and become more cordial.<br/>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>He had transformed from a minor celebrity, who happened to resemble Han Li’s white moonlight and might be useful, into a successfully embedded chess piece within the enemy’s ranks, ready to be utilized at any time.<br/>Seeing that he had gained enough trust, Shen Kong seized the opportunity to bring up the question he had asked during his last meeting with Tang-ge: <br/>“By the way, Tang-ge, I remember asking if you could tell me something about Han Li and Ye Jinghuan, and you said you weren’t sure. So, can I ask, if that’s the case, how did you know that Han Li’s white moonlight and cinnabar mole was Ye Jinghuan?”<br/>There was silence on the other end of the line.<br/>Shen Kong pressed on:<br/>“Because now that I can finally have more contact with President Han, understanding more about him will help me gain his trust. Even the smallest bit of information might come in handy.” <br/>Tang-ge hesitated for a moment before seemingly making up his mind and replying:<br/>“Han Li’s high school records were completely sealed through connections after he returned to the country. We pieced together his past life based on various indirect channels. It’s said that Ye Jinghuan was the direct reason Han Li was sent abroad…”<br/>Shen Kong’s interest was piqued:<br/>“What do you mean?” <br/>“We investigated the events in the city where Han Li was during his high school years. Three months before he was sent abroad, Han Li had a major conflict with the Wang family’s local businesses. He brought down two of their casinos and three clubs, and then significantly reduced their holdings in the entire southeast region by almost eighty percent. Even the Wang family’s direct heir, who was sent there for training, was nearly implicated. And somehow, Han Li managed all this without leaving any trace of his true identity.”<br/>Tang-ge paused, then continued:<br/>“Shortly after that incident, a student used connections to uncover Han Li’s true identity in City A and spread this information around, causing quite a stir at the time. The Wang family then discovered his connection to the Han family and pressured the Han family patriarch, who forcibly sent Han Li abroad to study. His local businesses were confiscated and shut down.”<br/>Shen Kong listened attentively to these events that occurred after he had been transported away, gradually piecing together his blank memories. A brand-new image of Han Li began to replace the boy-next-door image in his mind. <br/>Tang-ge continued, “Although we haven’t yet found the exact reason for Han Li’s furious assault on the Wang family, we have reason to believe it might be related to Ye Jinghuan.”<br/>Shen Kong asked, “Why?”<br/>“We later sent people to ask that student why he exposed Han Li’s identity. He wouldn’t say what Han Li did to him, but through his friends, we learned that he acted impulsively out of jealousy because he had a crush on Ye Jinghuan in high school. So, it’s very likely that all this started from a teenage love rivalry…”<br/>Shen Kong frowned and interrupted him, “So, your conclusions are all based on these flimsy, indirect pieces of evidence?” <br/>Tang-ge was silent for a moment. When he spoke again, his voice carried a hint of concealed frustration:<br/>“I initially thought it was too hasty, but my… superiors believed it was worth a try.”<br/>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>Shen Kong recalled the recording he made after the interview that day. Tang-ge’s tone was indeed very hesitant, but the person on the other end of the line had flatly dismissed his concerns—clearly, he had been speaking with Han Li’s idiot brother.<br/>After all, you have to be quite foolish to come up with a plan to use a substitute as a spy. <br/>Tang-ge’s voice regained its calmness:<br/>“However, if I had doubts about this plan before, seeing you successfully get close to Han Li has erased my last bit of skepticism——This is pretty much all the information we have. You’ll have to handle the rest on your own.”<br/>After hanging up, Shen Kong, holding his slightly heated phone, frowned and sat in deep thought.<br/>Although he had pried out the reason for seeking Ye Jinghuan’s substitute from Tang-ge, the mystery had only deepened, with more questions piling up instead of clearing away. <br/>So after he left that point in time, why did Han Li launch such a frenzied retaliation against the Wang family?<br/>According to the timeline, Han Li was sent abroad six months earlier than in the original storyline. His relationship with Ye Jinghuan shouldn’t have been that deep yet, but there’s no other clear explanation. After all, the housekeeper didn’t die, and the bullying didn’t happen… so what could it be?<br/>There must be some clue he overlooked.<br/>As Shen Kong was deep in thought, his phone buzzed twice in his hand: it was a message from his agent. <br/>Due to Meng Mingxuan’s newfound fame—being controversial is a hot commodity in the entertainment industry—a rain of variety show invitations had come flying in like snowflakes. His agent had seized the opportunity and accepted a variety show for him.<br/>Shen Kong opened the variety show’s introduction and fell silent.<br/>It turned out to be a survival show in the wilderness.</div>
