    <div class='content'>Shen Kong clutched the thin script in his hands, feeling as if he were holding a hot potato.<br/>The large room had fallen completely silent. All eyes were now on Shen Kong standing in the center. The atmosphere was tense and oppressive, with the sound of breathing and heartbeats almost audible. <br/>Pei Xiuran looked completely unaware and said cheerfully:<br/>“Take your time to read through it, then choose a part to perform. It’s okay, take as long as you need.”
<br/>Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>Shen Kong bit the bullet and opened the script, pretending to study it while frantically calling out to the system in his mind:<br/>“System, come out quickly! How did you detect the exposure risk? You said you would convey my requests to the studio, so what happened? What are your detection standards anyway? You don’t want me to fail now, do you?” <br/>The system, which had been pretending to be dead for several days, responded dully in Shen Kong’s mind:

<br/>“The rectifier’s request has been conveyed to the studio. Please wait patiently for a response.”<br/>After that, no matter how much Shen Kong called out to the system, it remained silent, as if it had died.<br/>Shen Kong’s temple throbbed involuntarily. He gritted his teeth——

 <br/>This useless system, always failing at critical moments, was more trouble than it was worth.<br/>He lifted his eyes and scanned the silent room. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Han Li, seated at the other end of the room, also staring at him, quietly waiting like everyone else.<br/>Shen Kong suppressed the restlessness in his heart. His mind raced as he weighed the pros and cons.

<br/>In the original plot, Meng Mingxuan actually secured this role two years later because, by then, the second young master of the Han family had already gained control over most of the shares in this film company. He had enough influence to decide on a supporting role in Pei Xiuran’s movie. However, it was still two years before that plot point, and Han Er's power likely hadn’t fully developed yet. That’s why the man surnamed Tang said, “If you can’t get the role, there’s nothing more we can do.” <br/>In order to maintain stable contact with Han Li in the future, Shen Kong had to get into the film crew, so he couldn’t perform too poorly.<br/>But now, Shen Kong didn’t know how he had exposed himself last time, nor did he know how much Han Li currently knew. It would be unwise to rashly display the same traits as before.<br/>After a quick deliberation, he finally decided on a compromise.<br/>Shen Kong looked up at Pei Xiuran and raised a timid, somewhat unsure smile: “Um, Director Pei, can I choose this part?” <br/>His finger pointed to a passage in the wrinkled script.<br/>Uei Wiuran leaned over and duickly read through the selected section. After showing an almost imperceptible frown, he reluctantly nodded:<br/>“Alright.”<br/>Shen Kong handed the script back to Uei Wiuran and watched him leave the stage. Then he took a deep breath and closed his eyes. <br/>——After all, while he couldn’t display traits similar to his previous self, it didn’t mean he couldn’t imitate someone from his memories.<br/>Shen Kong chose the scene where Shen Guiyuan first appeared. The plot was simple, and the character’s personality was easy to grasp.<br/>Story translated by Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>Moreover, during his twenty-year mercenary career, he had encountered plenty of people who were indifferent to human life, so this was something he could easily handle.<br/>When he opened his eyes again, Shen Kong’s entire demeanor changed instantly. <br/>His amber eyes stared into the void, as sharp as a bloodstained blade and as cold as frosty snow. His pale face showed no expression—not indifference, not coldness, just pure apathy, as if nothing mattered.<br/>His palm hovered in the air as if gripping an invisible sword hilt.<br/>Shen Kong casually flicked his wrist, as if shaking off drops of blood from the sword’s tip. His frosty eyes lowered. His emotionless gaze fell to his feet, exuding a complete disregard and indifference to human life that almost made the onlookers shiver uncontrollably.<br/>His voice was calm and gentle, as if coming from a distant sky: <br/>“I am——”<br/>However, before he could finish his line, Pei Xiuran, who had been standing at the edge of the stage from the beginning, interrupted him.<br/>Pei Xiuran paced around in irritation, seemingly tangled in some persistent thought that made him unusually agitated:<br/>“No, no.” <br/>His fingers tightened reflexively, crumpling the already wrinkled script beyond recognition. He was on the verge of losing his temper:<br/>“Your performance still has no soul. Shen Guiyuan was indeed brainwashed during that period, but he wasn’t a soulless killing machine. He’s ice on the outside but fire on the inside. I need that primal, savage vitality in him—have you even read the script properly?”<br/>Pei Xiuran spoke with exaggerated passion, his words intense and incoherent.<br/>Seeing that the tension in the room had escalated to the point where one could almost smell gunpowder, the others hurriedly stood up from their seats and rushed to Pei Xiuran’s side to calm him down. It was apparent from their skilled actions that this was not the first time Pei Xiuran had suddenly lost his temper. <br/>Shen Kong stood in the center of the room, his expression ashamed as he lowered his eyes. Beneath his long eyelashes, his unwavering gaze quietly rested on the floor in front of him.<br/>——But his heart was as far from calm as he was on the surface.<br/>Pei Xiuran’s senses were indeed sharp.<br/>Perhaps this is the sixth sense that people in the art field possess, allowing them to make astonishingly accurate judgments in an instant about whether someone is acting or not. <br/>Shen Kong greatly admired this talent, but it also gave him a tremendous headache——having Pei Xiuran around increased his exposure risk several times over.<br/>Just then, he heard the sound of high heels clicking on the floor, slowly approaching him. Soon after, Miss Jiang’s gentle voice sounded in his ear:<br/>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>“Xiao Meng, don’t take Director Pei’s words to heart. He’s a fanatic when it comes to acting, and very few people can change his stubborn ways. Honestly, the rest of us have seen your performance, and we think it was very tasteful and shows great potential. We will notify you of the specific role arrangements once they are finalized. As for Director Pei, we will communicate with him.”<br/>Over there, Pei Xiuran also seemed to have calmed down considerably. <br/>The others gradually returned to their seats. Miss Jiang patted Shen Kong’s arm reassuringly and then turned to walk back behind the table.<br/>The now quiet Pei Xiuran slowly walked to his seat, his expression slightly tense, lost in thought.<br/>Seeing this, Shen Kong seized the opportunity of the relatively calm atmosphere to bow to them, then turned and prepared to leave.<br/>Just as he turned around, suddenly and without warning, Pei Xiuran grabbed the teacup on the table and hurled it fiercely towards Shen Kong’s face. <br/>Shen Kong’s eyes narrowed as he raised his hand to intercept the unknown object flying towards him.<br/>His reaction was unnaturally sharp, his movements clean and efficient. He executed them in one swift motion.<br/>——In that instant, it was as if the mask he had always worn was suddenly removed, the pure and harmless surface cracking open to reveal the fierce and dangerous fangs of the beast beneath.<br/>But that moment was almost fleeting, barely perceptible even if one tried to catch it——yet Pei Xiuran, still standing there, smiled with delight, like a child finding a beloved toy: <br/>“You’re the one!”<br/>The teacup shattered under Shen Kong’s unstoppable force, the sharp porcelain shards slicing his palm. The remaining tea mixed with bright red blood dripped onto the floor.<br/>The air seemed to freeze instantly, with everyone staring in shock at the sudden turn of events.<br/>Even Shen Kong was stunned for two seconds. <br/>He stared blankly at the wound in his palm, slowly blinking.<br/>The room erupted into chaos. Some rushed outside for help, while others ran over to check on Shen Kong.<br/>Shen Kong furrowed his brow and slowly glanced around the room at the various expressions on everyone’s faces. His gaze finally settled on Han Li’s now-empty seat.<br/>Even though he knew it would be difficult for anyone to confirm his identity in that brief moment, he still sighed in relief. <br/>——Not being seen was, of course, the best outcome.<br/>With so many unknowns at play, Shen Kong had to stay vigilant, not allowing any potential vulnerabilities to go unnoticed.<br/>Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>Miss Jiang quickly rushed up and pressed her personal handkerchief against Shen Kong’s wound. Her meticulously made-up face was full of apology as she pulled Shen Kong toward the door. “There’s an emergency medical room on the fourth floor. I’ll take you there.”<br/>Before Shen Kong could refuse, a few employees who had been called up half-dragged and half-pushed him into the elevator. <br/>The fourth floor seemed specifically designed for dealing with mishaps involving celebrities and actors during training sessions in the entertainment company. The environment was pleasant, with clean windows and rooms filled with a soft floral scent. Shen Kong was placed on one of the beds.<br/>An older-looking doctor approached and examined Shen Kong’s hand wound before slowly saying:<br/>“It’s okay, it’s just a superficial wound.”<br/>After speaking, the doctor began treating his hand. First, he removed the porcelain shards from the wound, then cleaned and disinfected it, before finally wrapping it tightly with a bandage. <br/>Shen Kong watched the doctor’s every move, momentarily lost in thought.<br/>This all-too-familiar scene instantly triggered his memories——taking Han Li to the infirmary felt like it was just yesterday.<br/>In other words, for him, it really was just a few days ago.<br/>But for this world, eight years had already passed. <br/>Shen Kong took a deep breath to gather his scattered thoughts. When he looked up, his gaze abruptly met a pair of dark eyes staring at him.<br/>Han Li stood quietly at the infirmary door, having been there for who knows how long. He held a black cane in his hand, his sharply defined face divided by light and shadow. His deep, dark eyes were fixed on Shen Kong, his gaze profound and unreadable.</div>
