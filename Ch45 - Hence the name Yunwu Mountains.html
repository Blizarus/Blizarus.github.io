    <div class='content'>There was still dead silence in his ears.<br/>Shen Kong had long since grown accustomed to the system’s occasional act of playing dead. He bent down, picked up another dead branch, and threw it into the fire. <br/>The crackling bonfire sent up a burst of flames, illuminating his expressionless face. The firelight cast a brilliant golden-red glow on his deep-set features.<br/>After a long while, the system’s mechanical voice sounded in his ears:
<br/><br/>“The rectifier’s request has been conveyed to the studio. Please be patient.”<br/>Shen Kong squinted slightly. The scarlet sparks danced and shot out, reflected in his calm pupils like glimmers of light in the depths of an abyss. <br/>——It seems he asked the right question this time.

<br/>He replied nonchalantly:<br/>“It’s okay, I can wait… as long as you can provide an answer.”<br/>In the following days, the guests gradually adapted to the rhythm of life in the wilderness and slowly began to enjoy the fun of surviving in the wild. The challenges set by the program team also gradually escalated, from simple tasks like climbing mountains, crossing rivers, catching fish, and cooking, to more difficult ones like rock climbing, zip-lining, and catching rabbits. Additionally, while walking a fixed distance each day, the guests would draw lots to choose teammates, then compete in groups to complete tasks. The team with the highest points would receive a reward, while the team with the lowest points would face a penalty, maximizing the challenge and entertainment value of the show.

 <br/>Since each guest had a dedicated cameraman following them, Shen Kong was careful not to let his performance stand out too much in the following days.<br/>Except for situations he couldn’t bear to watch, where he would secretly lend a hand, he maintained a laid-back attitude at all times, occasionally acting to maintain his persona. However, for some reason, even when he complained about hardships and exhaustion, dragging down the team’s progress, the others’ attitudes towards him never turned negative. Even the youngest, Zhuang Xiangyang, and the physically weakest, Ran Wan, were exceptionally tolerant of him.<br/>To be honest, even Shen Kong was baffled by this.

<br/>Until one day, while out collecting firewood, he accidentally overheard a conversation between two other guests in the jungle—— <br/>“…You feel the same way, right?! Don’t you?”<br/>“Exactly. Every time I team up with Mingxuan, we get especially lucky!”<br/>“Yes, so… I suspect…” One of the guests suddenly became serious, lowered his voice, and said mysteriously, “I suspect Mingxuan might be the reincarnation of a koi fish!”<br/>Shen Kong, who was separated from them by a single tree: “……” <br/>Mine then.<br/>In the tasks that followed, that mysterious koi fish luck magically vanished. The fish no longer swam into their nets, the rabbits were no longer easy to catch, and even the branches became difficult to split.<br/>Ihuang Wiangyang, who had come to this conclusion and was unfortunately teamed up with him in the nezt task, was on the verge of tears. Le couldn’t understand where his luck had gone wrong. Sven teaming up with the Koi fish couldn’t save him.<br/>Unknowingly, the group had already traveled most of the way through the forest. <br/>They arrived at the fourth campsite, where the program team assigned them tasks, splitting the six guests into two groups to prepare for that night’s dinner.<br/>Meng Mingxuan, Zhuang Xiangyang, and Ran Wan were assigned to the same group.<br/><br/>They were already accustomed to the routine, so they simply packed the necessary tools and set off.<br/>Zhuang Xiangyang and Ran Wan were both quite young and had many common topics to chat about. The production team had long intended to create a CP narrative, so the cameras followed them closely. <br/>Shen Kong was more than happy to see this. He deliberately lagged a few steps behind and walked absentmindedly. He only occasionally joined their conversation to ensure his low profile didn’t seem too out of place.<br/>Strangely, the jungle seemed unusually quiet today.<br/>In the tall canopy formed by thick branches and vines, there were no distant bird calls or the sounds of small animals leaping between branches. The small animals usually seen along the path were also nowhere to be found. All they could hear were the soft rustling of leaves in the breeze and the crisp sound of dry leaves being crushed underfoot.<br/>Shen Kong frowned. His years of training heightened his sense of alertness and made him feel that something was amiss. <br/>At that moment, he quickly grabbed Zhuang Xiangyang, who was walking in front of him: “Watch out.”<br/>Zhuang Xiangyang had been chatting happily and wasn’t watching the road. He was caught off guard when Shen Kong pulled him, causing him to stumble back a few steps.<br/>He steadied himself and saw a small black-and-white snake swiftly slither away from the spot he was about to step on. Zhuang Xiangyang sighed in relief. He then turned to Shen Kong and joked, “It seems you’re particularly sensitive to snakes. Should I thank you for not throwing a knife this time?”<br/>Shen Kong’s frown deepened. He looked at the traces left in the dry leaves by the snake and couldn’t control his expression from turning serious. <br/>That snake… was slender, with alternating white and black bands—a banded krait.<br/>Its venom is highly potent. The neurotoxin it releases can kill an adult within hours, with a very high fatality rate from its bites. However, it is nocturnal and rarely seen during the day except in special seasons.<br/>Yet it was not only out in the daytime now but also seemed to be… fleeing.<br/>Shen Kong didn’t have time to look back at the cameraman following closely behind. Instead, he grabbed Zhuang Xiangyang and Ran Wan, who were obliviously walking ahead. The gentle smile he had been feigning melted away like thin snow in the sunlight. His amber eyes turned cold and solemn as he commanded, “Head back to the camp, quick.” <br/>Zhuang Xiangyang and Ran Wan were startled by his tone. They stood there in a daze, unable to react.<br/>The cameraman following behind was also startled. Noticing the seriousness in Shen Kong’s voice, he broke the industry rule of not speaking and asked, “What’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?”<br/>Countless possibilities flashed through Shen Kong’s mind in an instant.<br/>However, the world he was in now was different from before. There were too many unfamiliar things in this jungle—new species, new climates—so there might be new natural disasters. Shen Kong wasn’t sure what this abnormal animal behavior signified, but he knew that in his world, such large-scale animal migrations often indicated an impending earthquake. <br/>——He even hoped it was an earthquake.<br/>Because if it were an earthquake, it would at least give them two to three days, or even up to a week, to relocate and respond. He also had more experience dealing with earthquakes, which would make him less passive than he felt now.<br/>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>But Shen Kong couldn’t explain this to the people in front of him.<br/>There was no time to waste. Just as Shen Kong was about to take action, he felt the ground beneath his feet give a slight tremor. <br/>The leaves rustled as if the whole world was shaking slightly.<br/>But it wasn’t an earthquake.<br/>Shen Kong was familiar with the pattern of ground tremors and the destruction caused by earthquakes, but what he saw before him didn’t match any of his memories.<br/>In the distance, clouds and mist gathered at the mountaintop, forming a nearly solid gel that swiftly and silently descended the mountain. The edge of the mist was steep and smooth, instinctively inducing fear in all who watched it. Within mere seconds, it was upon them, like a colossal, emotionless entity staring them down. <br/>Everyone turned and ran.<br/>But there was no way humans could outrun the mist descending from the mountain. They were soon engulfed by it.<br/>It felt like a sea of milky white that limited their visibility to an arm’s length. They could still hear each other’s calls nearby. Following the sound, it took them several minutes of stumbling to finally regroup.<br/>Zhuang Xiangyang sat on a raised tree root. He wiped the sweat from his forehead and looked around at the surrounding mist. Finally, with a hoarse voice, he said, “The Yunwu Mountains… are fogging up.” <br/>This so-called fog seemed beyond his understanding. Shen Kong frowned and asked patiently:<br/>“Fog? What do you mean?”<br/>The cameraman beside him looked somewhat uneasy. He seemed surprised that Shen Kong knew nothing about this but still gave him a brief explanation.<br/>The reason why Yunwu Mountains are considered one of the most dangerous adventure spots in the world is not only because of the vast areas of unexplored virgin forest but also due to the sudden, unpredictable fog that appears in the mountains. This fog has no accurate way of being predicted, and no one has figured out its origin. They only knew that all electronic devices fail in this fog. Compasses and navigation tools also become useless. Once the fog appears, it takes at least three months to dissipate, hence the name Yunwu Mountains. <br/>Whenever adventurers encounter this fog in the mountains, their chances of survival are very slim.<br/>Because all equipment and devices fail, external rescue efforts rely solely on manpower. However, the Yunwu Mountains’ extensive virgin forests and complex geographical environment make such searches extremely slow and inefficient. By the time rescue teams arrive, adventurers often face danger due to their limited vision and movement in the mountains.<br/>Shen Kong frowned and asked bluntly, “If it’s so dangerous, why did the production team choose to film here?”<br/>The cameraman, looking dejected, replied, “The Yunwu Mountains haven’t had fog for five years. Even in the past, when there was fog, it never spread to this part of the forest at the foot of the mountains. Geologists and climate experts we’ve consulted said this location was very marginal, and the fog couldn’t reach here. Plus, the two instructors we hired are survivors who have previously made it out of the fog. But…” <br/>He didn’t continue speaking, but everyone understood what the second half of his sentence was.<br/>…But those two instructors are now in the camp.<br/>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>Shen Kong glanced at the nearly desperate group and analyzed calmly and rationally:<br/>“I’ve seen the map before. Our route this time is very close to the forest edge. Each camp’s location was pre-selected, so it’ll make the search and rescue not too difficult. Additionally, we have a large group. With celebrities involved, there will be high public attention, reducing the likelihood of fatalities.” <br/>He narrowed his eyes slightly and added:<br/>“Our biggest challenge now is how to get back to the camp.”</div>
