        "His new assistant, Xiao Lin, placed the overstuffed bag on the table with a “thud.” The program crew opened the suitcase, stepped aside to make space, and let Shen Kong think about which three items he would choose.",
        "Shen Kong lowered his head and reached into the suitcase, rummaging through its contents. ",
        "Strictly speaking, he had spent far more time in various wildernesses and extreme environments than he had in cities. He had once lurked in the rainforest without any backup for two and a half months, had crossed ice fields on foot alone, and had trekked through deserts. Those desolate jungles and forgotten snowy cliffs were more familiar to him than friends. Whether he was carrying dozens of kilograms of firearms or just a small knife, he could handle it with ease, like a fish in the water.",
        "This was why he didn’t want to accept this program.\n",
        "Chrysanthemum Garden.",
        "An environment he was too familiar with was more likely to expose his true nature.",
        "Shen Kong carefully selected three items: a bottle of sunscreen, a bottle of moisturizer, and a Swiss army knife. ",
        "The instructor standing beside him glanced at the items in Shen Kong’s hands, then looked at his innocent expression. His brows furrowed as if he could crush a fly between them. He confirmed once more, “Are you sure?”\n\n",
        "Shen Kong earnestly nodded and said:",
        "“The more you are in the wild, the more you need to protect your skin. After all, such environments are extremely harsh and very damaging to the skin.”",
        "Several other celebrities turned their heads in astonishment.\n\n ",
        "Although they knew that beauty and appearance were paramount in the entertainment industry, showing such a strong desire for skincare in a wilderness survival program was seen as not knowing how to prioritize and being overly pampered, which was very likely to attract negative attention.",
        "Even the staff members standing by the table showed a bit of disdain in their eyes.",
        "This Zeng Zingzuan was clearly a short-sighted and vain pretty face. At a time like this, still worrying about skincare and sunscreen, he hadn’t brought any tools useful for the wild besides the small knife. It was evident he wasn’t taking the theme of the program seriously.\n\n",
        "Some insiders had a faint look of schadenfreude on their faces. ",
        "It seemed likely that once he was in the program, this pampered little star would surely suffer.",
        "As the packing session ended, the instructors distributed the survival backpacks prepared by the program team to the guests. Shen Kong hefted the heavy backpack in his hand, getting a sense of its contents. While the others curiously rummaged through their backpacks, Shen Kong slipped his small knife into his pocket and unzipped the bag to throw in the moisturizer and sunscreen.",
        "Next, the director finally revealed the mysterious filming location for the program:",
        "The Yunwu Mountains in City E. ",
        "The celebrities all displayed expressions of amazement. Even Duan Mingcheng, who had remained calm and composed from the beginning, showed a bit of excitement.",
        "Since all the place names in this book are fictional, Shen Kong had no knowledge of the locations in this world. He had to cooperate by showing a surprised expression, though he was still utterly confused inside. Luckily, for the sake of filming, the director gave the guests a detailed introduction to the famous Yunwu Mountains.",
        "The Yunwu Mountains are the largest mountain range spanning the entire country, and the section within City E has the highest coverage of undeveloped virgin forest in the world. Due to the rugged terrain and lack of human presence, it has only recently begun to be developed in the past two years. However, its danger level is extremely high; even experienced extreme survivalists find it challenging to venture within twenty kilometers of the forest’s edge. It is rated as one of the most dangerous jungles in the world.",
        "Finally, the director revealed today’s last surprise. ",
        "He led them to the huge window on one side of the lounge, reached out to pull the retractable cord, and the blinds that had been drawn since they entered the room lifted, revealing a vast, open plain outside. On the ground was a brand-new, luxurious private jet. The sleek, white wings gleamed in the brilliant sunlight, and through the cabin windows, one could vaguely see the spacious and opulent interior.",
        "The director turned around and introduced to the guests, who were standing by the window with amazed expressions:",
        "",
        "“Our travel arrangements this time are sponsored by LiShi Corporation. We thank the company for their strong support of our program.”",
        "Shen Kong subtly raised an eyebrow—LiShi? Why did that name sound so familiar? ",
        "Before he could figure it out, the director enthusiastically continued, “This private jet belongs to President Han of LiShi. We also thank him for generously lending it to our program!”",
        "The guests cooperatively cheered and applauded.",
        "Amid the lively applause, Shen Kong’s eyebrows twitched slightly—now he knew why LiShi sounded so familiar.",
        "It was a company under Han Li’s control. ",
        "Shen Kong’s gaze unfocused as he clapped along with everyone else, a clear thought slowly forming in his mind:",
        "So this is how great it feels to be a kept man?",
        "By the time they got off the plane, it was already evening. The guests were arranged to rest in a hotel booked by the program team, and they would set off for the Yunwu Mountains early the next morning.",
        "The room was an ordinary business room. Shen Kong casually tossed the large bag onto the bed and took a quick shower in the bathroom. ",
        "Ten minutes later, he came out wrapped in a bath towel and wiped away the fog on the mirror. The man reflected in the mirror had a bare, wet upper body, with muscles faintly visible under his skin. Under the bathroom light, his body looked like smooth, damp marble, with every stretch and curve appearing both graceful and powerful.",
        "Unlike Cheng Chen, Meng Mingxuan, as a celebrity, paid a lot of attention to his physique. Although he focused on maintaining a light and slender boyish look, his physical condition was much better than his temporary identity in the previous plot point.",
        "With a good foundation to start with and having spent a considerable amount of time in this plot point, Meng Mingxuan’s physical condition had improved significantly under Shen Kong’s care. While it still couldn’t match his original battle-hardened body, it was more than sufficient for a wilderness survival show.",
        "Just as Shen Kong was lost in thought, his phone suddenly chimed twice. He checked it and found a message from Tang-ge. ",
        "Shen Kong read through the message ten lines at a glance and summarized its main point in his mind:",
        "It was time for him, this kept little star, to pay his respects to his benefactor.",
        "This put Shen Kong in a difficult position.",
        "Since the celebration banquet for the start of 《Guiyuan Tower》, he hadn’t seen Han Li, let alone contacted him. All the resources and contracts had been delivered directly through people at the company——It wasn’t that he suddenly became aloof and unwilling to contact Han Li… but he simply didn’t have Han Li’s contact information at all!
