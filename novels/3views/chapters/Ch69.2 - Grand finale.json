        "Due to Han Li’s sudden and extreme suicidal action earlier, the entire small world’s trajectory was threatened, causing a chain reaction that forced the studio to deploy Shen Kong’s main body into the small world. This time, they didn’t even have time to find a temporary identity for him. Their interference in the small world was further reduced, and now, obtaining visual and audio footage from it was the best result the studio could achieve after several days of forced operation. His greatest fear now was whether the other party would discover another issue…",
        "As if to confirm his suspicions, the man’s voice came through the loudspeaker in the control room at that moment. It was calm, rational, and methodical, yet it slid up his spine like a snake flicking its tongue: ",
        "“——And according to my understanding, as long as the task fails, my temporary contract with the studio will be null and void, correct?”",
        "“And before I accepted the long-term contract, you sent me back into this world…”\n",
        "",
        "“So, there’s no contractual binding between us anymore, is there?”",
        "The other party’s emotionless voice, like a scalpel gleaming with silver light, precisely peeled back the skin and cut open the blood vessels and nerves, exposing the stark white truth: ",
        "“Then what was the reason behind your question?”\n\n",
        "“‘Rectifier, do you confirm to return to the main system space?’… Tsk,” Shen Kong repeated indifferently, then let out a cold chuckle. The light clicking sound of his tongue traveled through the loudspeaker, accurately reaching the control room and sending chills down their spines.",
        "“The current situation has long gone beyond your control. You simply cannot take me away from this world anymore. The reason you asked that question was just to keep this live reality show going.”",
        "“According to the information I obtained from your world, it seems my live stream is quite popular there, isn’t it? You offered me this choice to see if I would choose to stay for ‘love,’ right? And then? Continue to monitor me? Ensure the ongoing broadcast of this channel?”\n\n ",
        "Shen Kong spoke slowly, each word sharp and piercing.",
        "The master controller stared at the screen, flickering with static. He was suddenly horrified to notice that Shen Kong’s lips were actually moving——He didn’t know when it started, but Shen Kong was no longer communicating with the system in his mind. Instead, he was speaking out loud——!",
        "Whether the rectifier spoke to the system in his mind or said it out loud, it would be faithfully relayed back. Lowever, the audience in the live stream could only see and hear the words the rectifier actually spoke. Gue to the data transmission delay and Shen Kong’s meticulous and precise “hypothesis,” the master controller momentarily lost his composure and failed to notice when Shen Kong started to directly verbalihe his deductions——\n\n",
        "Sweat beaded on the controller’s forehead as he jumped from his seat in panic. His voice was trembling and cracking: ",
        "“Quick! Shut down the live stream! Cut the data feed!”",
        "But it was already too late.",
        "Everything had already been broadcast.",
        "When the company initially conducted scientific research and went public, their promotional emphasis was on “a realistic, safe, and risk-free immersive experience.” All the viewers believed that the experiences sold and the live streams conducted were in a virtual world—a novel, an illusion. They thought all the characters and environmental backgrounds were constructed from words in their world, so they enjoyed it without any guilt. ",
        "The previous incident where the small world rejected higher-dimensional beings’ entry was deliberately concealed by them. They suspended the immersive experience applications under the pretense of launching a new type of business. They deployed one of the novel characters as a rectifier into the small world and conducted a live broadcast to attract viewers. During this period, their constructors worked overtime to reconnect and maintain the small world, attempting to reopen the passage between the two dimensions.",
        "Shen Kong was actually chosen by vote.",
        "He himself was a highly popular character in a small world and one of the most favored targets. His deployment into another small world to interact with another highly popular villain caused the attention level of what was initially a diversionary live broadcast to soar. Even the company’s stock price rose, prompting the controller to make a decision:",
        "Keep Shen Kong, sign him as a formal employee of the studio, and develop a new entertainment project featuring interactions between characters from different small worlds. ",
        "Unexpectedly, these two characters, supposedly from lower dimensions, developed a sense of resistance. Han Li’s self-destructive tendencies directly led to the complete collapse of his world’s main storyline. Shen Kong not only found loopholes in the company’s meticulously calculated plans and escaped but also impacted the real interests of the company in the higher dimension, which was supposed to remain unaffected.",
        "——The most terrifying part was that, due to the heartfelt confession moment between the two, the live stream’s viewership reached an all-time high.",
        "",
        "The controller slumped into his chair, feeling the cold sweat soaking his back.",
        "He could almost see what tomorrow would bring. ",
        "Numerous media outlets, long targeting the company, would move like sharks smelling blood, all trying to tear a piece of flesh from them. Human rights organizations, which had been eyeing them, would finally have an excuse to launch a scathing attack on the company. Meanwhile, malicious competitors would seize the opportunity to snatch more market share…",
        "But the most terrifying threat was from their supporters.",
        "Consumers who thought they were just having fun in a virtual world would now bear a heavy moral burden because of the company. They will inevitably see themselves as victims and turn against the company to ease their conscience. They would ignore the fact that their curiosity had fueled this industry. Fans of the characters would react even more strongly. No one would want to find out that their beloved characters were real people being exploited and controlled by the company. Their love and admiration for the characters would undoubtedly turn into endless hatred for the company.",
        "As the focus of multiple forces and the target of consumer outrage, the company would inevitably become the public enemy. ",
        "The controller closed his eyes in despair. He was merely a high-level employee responsible for monitoring and adjusting the small world. Facing such a massive crisis threatening the entire company, he had no ability to respond.",
        "He took a deep breath and pressed the alarm button on the desk.",
        "The hazard indicator, symbolizing the highest level of danger, began flashing. This was the second time it had been activated since the company’s founding.",
        "Once for Han Li, and once for Shen Kong. ",
        "The entire pale control center was bathed in red light, including the massive screen that nearly covered the entire wall in front of the controller.",
        "Although the live stream had been cut off, the top section of the screen still showed an active feed.",
        "In the static-filled image, Shen Kong still wore that nonchalant expression, completely unaware of the astonishing actions he had just taken, as if he had merely brushed off some ash or blown away a cloud.",
        "He extinguished the cigarette, brushed the ash from his clothes, then lowered his legs and stepped into the darkness. ",
        "Shen Kong stood by the bed. His eyes, long adapted to the darkness, narrowed slightly as he gazed down at the bulging figure beneath the covers. The other person’s breathing remained steady and even, as if they hadn’t been disturbed, but Shen Kong knew that Han Li had woken up the moment he spoke."
