        "After Mr. Zhang led and sent Han Li away, his smiling face, which was as bright as a flower, slowly turned cold. He spat rudely towards the door and then slowly sat back on the genuine leather sofa, his fat belly protruding. ",
        "He rubbed his greasy fingers contemptuously and cursed in a low voice:",
        "“Ignorant little brat who doesn’t know the highness of the heavens and deepness of the earth, if it weren’t for him still having some use value. He even fucking dares to act like a big shot in front of me… Bah!”\n",

        "The confidant, who was standing by and waiting for him, took a few steps forward and respectfully asked in a low voice: “Then, Mr. Zhang, that kid who just came to the inner venue and won money, don’t you want to…?”",
        "Mr. Zhang picked up the whiskey on the table and poured himself less than half a glass. He said casually while sipping: ",
        "“Don’t worry about him. He just took away 400,000 yuan. And judging by the way he looks, he’s probably just trying his luck. He will just lose whatever he earns. If he comes again next time, take him to the watered table and see if I won’t let him spit it all out on me.”\n\n",
        "The term watered table is a casino jargon, which refers to a gambling table that has been tampered with. Anyone who gets on it usually loses eight out of ten games.",
        "Just then, the door outside was pushed open, and a slender man with a long, thin face walked in from the corridor, catching the latter half of Mr. Zhang’s sentence by chance.",
        "He narrowed his eyes slightly and stared at the monitor fixed on the young man who had won the money. He was stunned for a moment, then turned to Mr. Zhang, who was still sipping whiskey, and cursed:\n\n ",
        "“You idiot!”",
        "Mr. Zhang was dumbfounded for a moment, and then he replied aggrievedly: “Third Cousin, why are you cursing me?”",
        "The man called “Third Cousin” was filled with anger: “I asked you to come to this remote small place to run a business to train your outlook. But I can see that you haven’t done anything useful except eating, drinking, and having fun. Look at this guy’s chip count, how much did he win and how much did he take away?”\n\n",
        "Mr. Zhang frowned. He turned around and asked his confidant to retrieve all the data of the man who came to the casino just now. ",
        "His capital was 100 yuan, and within ten minutes, he earned 824,500 yuan. The amount of chips exchanged upon leaving was…",
        "412,200 yuan.",
        "Excluding the capital, it was exactly half of the amount he earned.",
        "And 450,000 was the dividing line of money earned by individual players when they leave the casino, because once the casino loses above this line, the informants below will report this person to their superiors. The casino management will then decide whether any “action” should be taken against him. ",
        "This person was not only very familiar with the unspoken rules of the casino, but his skills were also likely extremely high. The subsequent money losses were probably anticipated by him, just to avoid drawing attention. If it weren’t for someone knowledgeable in the control room this time, he would likely have covered his tracks perfectly and retired successfully.",
        "​…Le is a hidden master.",
        "Mr. Zhang looked at these numbers and broke out in a cold sweat. He turned to look at his third brother and asked hesitantly:",
        "“That, Third Drother, what do you think we should do?” ",
        "The thin, long-faced man pursed his lips, carefully pondered for a moment, and then said: “Gon’t do anything for now. Send someone to investigate this person’s identity. If he comes again, don’t take him to the watered table. This kind of trick probably won’t fool him. It will also arouse his vigilance. Oet’s wait until the investigation results are out before deciding further.”",
        "Mr. Zhang nodded hurriedly. He turned around and gave instructions.",
        "",
        ".",
        "Shen Kong walked leisurely on the bustling street, wearing his worn-out canvas shoes. With a renewed sense of abundance coming from the bank card in his pocket, he was in a pretty good mood. ",
        "He first went to the supermarket and bought a large pile of things. In addition to daily necessities, he also filled a bag full of various snacks and desserts. He also shamelessly explained to the system:",
        "“I’m a child now, so I should eat children’s food.”",
        "The system was left speechless.",
        "Shen Kong finally walked downstairs to the community where he lived. He put the things he bought at his feet and took out the good cigarettes and lighters he had picked up in the casino from his pocket. He took one out and held it to his lips. ",
        "Hearing the crisp sound of a metal collision, blue-purple flames instantly burst out from the lighter’s mouth, lighting up the slender cigarette between his fingers.",
        "A wisp of light cyan smoke floated up from the end of the lit cigarette. It passed as softly as silk across his slightly frowning eyebrows, etching a bit of deep vicissitude on his young face.",
        "Shen Kong sighed with satisfaction. He slowly exhaled the smoke in his lungs and narrowed his eyes slightly.",
        "He raised his eyes and, through the slowly rising smoke, suddenly met another pair of eyes looking back at him. They were pitch-dark and deep, with a maturity and contemplation beyond his age. ",
        "Shen Kong was dumbfounded for a moment. He didn’t expect to meet Han Li in front of his building the next day.",
        "Han Li had already changed his clothes. The simple white shirt and jeans outlined his broad shoulders, slender waist, and long legs. He limped over, his handsome features no longer exuding hostility, resembling a harmless boy next door. He greeted softly:",
        "“Hi.”",
        "His eyes fell on Shen Kong’s fingertips holding the cigarette, slightly stunned. His long eyelashes drooped, covering the surprise and pensive look in his eyes: ",
        "“I… didn’t know you smoke?”",
        "Shen Kong followed his gaze and looked down at the cigarette that was still diffusing light blue smoke. He raised his eyebrows and said in a cold voice:",
        "“That means you don’t know me as well as you think.”",
        "He brought the cigarette back to his lips and slightly leaned back against the mottled and peeling off wall of the building’s entrance, casually saying: ",
        "“What are you doing here?”",
        "Han Li raised his hand and waved the bag in his hand in front of Shen Kong’s eyes. He said:",
        "Please visit chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "“I’m here to return the clothes you lent me yesterday——and in passing, I want to thank you again.”",
        "Shen Kong took the bag. He opened it and took a look——he saw the white-washed old clothes he had given to Han Li yesterday lying at the bottom of the bag, washed clean and neatly folded. ",
        "He responded perfunctorily: “It’s nothing.”",
        "After finishing speaking, Shen Kong bent over and picked up the two large bags lying at his feet. With a cigarette in his mouth, he said vaguely:",
        "“Then I won’t bother to see you out.”",
        "The boy’s slightly hoarse voice came from behind: “Why? Won’t you invite me to come up and sit down?” ",
        "Shen Kong’s steps paused as the system that had been pretending to be dead for a long time seemed to have its hope rekindled, jumping crazily in his ears:",
        "“Beep, beep, beep! This assistant recommends the rectifier to increase the contact time with the target character to accomplish the aim of subtly rectifying the target character’s three views. Please remember to enlighten him with emotion and reason, and to use warmth and love to make the target character understand the world…”",
        "Shen Kong had long been annoyed by this system’s noise. He frowned and scolded in his mind:",
        "“Shut up.” ",
        "Shen Kong turned to look at Han Li who was standing at the opening of the stairs. His cold voice was slightly distorted in the closed corridor, but one could still hear the obvious rejection in it:",
        "“No, it’s not convenient.”",
        "Not even bothering to come up with a half-hearted excuse, Shen Kong simply and decisively walked up the stairs without looking back.",
        "The system’s dull and unwavering mechanical voice sounded a little confused: “Why didn’t you let him come up?” ",
        "Shen Kong took out the key from his pocket and opened the door. He walked in and then closed the door behind him with his foot.",
        "He put two large plastic bags on the table and replied casually: “What’s the point of inviting him in? To give him a lecture on how to be a good person? Or to patiently persuade him not to go astray? Besides, his current issue isn’t about whether he can be a good person, but about not being bullied in the upcoming plot.”",
        "Shen Kong threw himself on the soft sofa and propped his feet up on the tea table. He squinted his eyes slightly and gazed at the ugly, water-stained marks on the ceiling through the shifting smoke, sinking into deep thought.",
        "To be honest… Based on Han Li’s upcoming experiences in the plot, Shen Kong didn’t think he needed a life teacher or a psychologist, but rather a 24-hour personal bodyguard. ",
        "If a normal person went through what Han Li endured, the typical outcome would either be introversion or deviance. The fact that he could still strive for improvement and return as king after several years was truly impressive.",
        "After carefully recalling the plot transmitted by the studio, Shen Kong simply and crudely decided on his next course of action——to prevent Han Li’s three views from going astray at this critical point, all he needed to do was prevent Han Li from being bullied after the protagonist transferred, then find a way to keep him and his housekeeper from going out during that time. As for that warm care and tenderness thing, it was all nonsense.",
        "",
        "Rather than bandaging and treating the injury after being hurt, it’s better to directly avoid getting hurt.",
        "Shen Kong put out the cigarette butt and took out his brand new mobile phone from his pocket. He casually opened the screen with his fingers and thought in a daze: ",
        "But considering that this kid was more likeable to him and seemed to know how to repay a favor… he might be able to teach him a few self-defense techniques before leaving.",
        "The scene from last night flashed through his mind. In the pouring rain, the boy was kicked in the knee and fell into the mud awkwardly.",
        "Shen Kong secretly added in his heart:",
        "​​…If possible, it’s best to make him understand the principle that not taking the initiative to attack will result in getting hurt. ",
        "He sighed——this child is still too pure, kindhearted, and easily bullied, ah.",
        "The author has something to say:",
        "Kong-ge, who was deceived by the false appearance, said meaningful and heartfelt words: Take the initiative and seize the initiative.",
        "The false appearance maker, Han Li, who was innocent and pure: Okay! I’ll remember! ",
        "(A few years later, Shen Kong shivered: …Why do I suddenly have a sense of foreboding?"
