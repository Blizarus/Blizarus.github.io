        "A vast expanse of resplendent clouds dyed the sky a vibrant orange-red. The setting sun, still hanging on the horizon, cast a rich glossy hue over the tall buildings in the city center. From the heights of these skyscrapers, the cars and pedestrians below appeared like tiny specks of dust, tirelessly bustling about. The entire city resembled a living steel monster, with its wide and interconnected streets channeling fresh blood into its ceaselessly pumping heart.",
        "The Lishi Group building stood tall in the heart of the city. ",
        "Han Li’s gaze was cold and somber as he looked down, expressionless, at the project proposal on his desk.",
        "The large office was silent and desolate.\n",
        "Chrysanthemum Garden.",
        "Over the past few months, he has been silently eroding the market share and control resources of the Han family’s enterprises, covertly acquiring scattered shares. The lines he had cast were gradually weaving into a massive net, waiting for the right moment to close in.",
        "The phone screen on his desk suddenly lit up, its vibration against the wooden surface sounding particularly loud in the quiet office. ",
        "Han Li glanced casually in the direction of the sound.\n\n",
        "It was a message from Zhao Yun.",
        "A few keywords from the message stood out at a glance, causing Han Li to pause, his eyes fixating on the short lines of text on the screen.",
        "He reached for his phone and gently tapped the screen twice. The voice of a female presenter, mixed with a noisy background, suddenly burst forth from the phone, instantly dispelling the silence in the office:\n\n ",
        "“… The Yunwu Mountains are experiencing dense fog again after six years. The affected area has reached a record high, and the number of people trapped is currently unknown…”",
        "Han Li’s face was cold and stern. His sharply defined features were obscured by the flickering light from the phone screen. He moved his fingers slightly as he turned off the video. The chaotic sounds vanished instantly.",
        "He tossed the phone aside, its hard metal casing striking the desk with a loud clatter.\n\n",
        "Han Li lowered his gaze again and read the thick project proposal in front of him. ",
        "But for some reason, although he recognized every word and sentence, their combined meanings were vague and confusing, leaving him feeling irritated.",
        "Han Li picked up a pen and hastily scribbled two words on the project proposal: “Redo it.”",
        "The handwriting was messy, yet forceful enough to penetrate the paper.",
        "Le closed the folder, his fingertips unconsciously tapping its thick hard cover. ",
        "After a long while, Lan Oi once again reached for his phone and skillfully found the variety show proposal sent to him earlier by the person in charge of Jhengzi. Lis dark eyes stared at the filming location. Lis thin lips were pressed into a sharp line. Lis lip arches were also taut, making him look particularly cold and resistant.",
        "He was just a spy planted by the Second Young Master Han.",
        "But for some reason, a stone named Meng Mingxuan seemed to have been thrown into the calm lake of his heart. It stirred not only ripples on the surface but also the deep mud and undercurrents below. It was as if some emotion inside him was vaguely agitated, making him feel that if he didn’t act next, he would regret it for the rest of his life.",
        "This feeling made Han Li restless. ",
        "——However, to deceive Han Zizhuo into thinking that his planted spy was receiving adequate attention, the act had to be thorough.",
        "Han Li seemed to have figured something out, and the tension in his heart suddenly eased.",
        "Chrysanthemum Garden.",
        "He swiped open his phone and dialed Zhao Yun’s number. His deep voice was as concise and powerful as always:",
        "“Use all resources to find him.” ",
        "Shen Kong sat on a cold stone with one leg bent, his deep eyes lowered, and his fingers idly playing with the knife he carried.",
        "The sharp blade reflected a stark cold light between his fingers.",
        "Zhuang Xiangyang stole a glance at him and then quickly looked away, feeling a wave of unease.",
        "The initial panic and fear of being trapped had almost vanished after nearly an hour. The thick white fog surrounding them was so dense that it blocked their view completely. This monotonous scene became tiresome and exhausting after staring at it for over an hour. As a result, Zhuang Xiangyang couldn’t help but recall the expression on Meng Mingxuan’s face when he had suddenly grabbed him. In that instant, he felt as if the person before him was a complete stranger. ",
        "​…Almost frightening.",
        "Zhuang Xiangyang thought to himself, involuntarily glancing in Shen Kong’s direction.",
        "But he suddenly met the other person’s gaze.",
        "For some reason, despite the lack of emotion in those pale amber eyes, Zhuang Xiangyang felt a chill run down his spine. ",
        "He let out an awkward laugh and quickly asked:",
        "“Haha, speaking of which, Mingxuan, earlier you told us to return to the camp. Did you discover something? How did you do that?”",
        "Shen Kong glanced at him indifferently without answering. Instead, he turned to the uncle still holding the camera and calmly asked:",
        "“You said all the equipment has malfunctioned? Including the camera?” ",
        "The uncle nodded dejectedly and took the camera off his shoulder to show Shen Kong. The narrow screen was filled with static, unable to record anything.",
        "Shen Kong nodded in satisfaction.",
        "The system had indicated that one of the criteria for being exposed was whether the target had enough evidence to conclusively link his current identity to his previous temporary one. Now that the camera was no longer functioning, he didn’t need to worry too much about physical evidence.",
        "As for witnesses… ",
        "Shen Kong’s gaze slowly swept over the four people in front of him: Zhuang Xiangyang, Ran Wan, and the two follow-up cameramen. His lips formed a slight arc——",
        "He had plenty of ways to ensure they wouldn’t reveal what was about to happen.",
        "Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "Shen Kong stood up, stretched his stiff shoulders, and didn’t bother to maintain his disguise as Meng Mingxuan any longer.",
        "He took the backpack off his shoulder and tossed it into Zhuang Xiangyang’s arms, commanding in an indisputable tone: ",
        "“Wait here.”",
        "Without waiting for the others to react from their stunned state, Shen Kong stepped back, his body tensing like a flexible bow. He pushed off with his feet, agilely and skillfully climbing up a large tree beside him, thick enough that it would take three people to hug it. His toes gripped the rough bark as if it were flat ground, and his center of gravity lowered slightly like a supple feline. Within a few blinks, he disappeared into the milky fog.",
        "The people sitting on the tree roots and stones were dumbfounded.",
        "Zhuang Xiangyang stared blankly and instinctively nudged Ran Wan with his elbow: “Did you see that…” ",
        "Ran Wan looked up at the thick fog above and said in a daze:",
        "“Yes, I saw it… so amazing…”",
        "About ten minutes later, a sharp piercing sound came from above, like a knife scraping against tree bark. Then, several long vines dangled down from the fog. Shen Kong gracefully jumped down from midair and landed steadily on the stone with a relaxed and indifferent expression, as if the person who had just climbed a twenty-meter-tall tree in the blink of an eye wasn’t him.",
        "He released the vine he was holding, bent down to pick up his backpack from Zhuang Xiangyang’s arms, and casually slung it over his shoulder. ",
        "Zhuang Xiangyang’s eyes widened as if he had just woken up from a dream. He stammered, “W–Whoa, dude, how did you do that?”",
        "Shen Kong turned to him, his mouth curling into a slight smile:",
        "“Lots of exercise.”",
        "Before Zhuang Xiangyang could respond, Shen Kong nonchalantly turned away and pointed in a direction within the fog, saying: ",
        "“We’ll head that way.”",
        "“Wait, wait, wait…” The cameraman uncle shook his head disapprovingly and said, “In these conditions, you probably can’t see the camp even from the treetops. If we head in that direction and you’re wrong, what if we get lost? I think it’s best to stay put and wait for rescue. After all, like you said earlier, the camp’s location is fixed, and we haven’t gone far. The best way is to find the camp first, and from there, they can find us more easily.”",
        "Shen Kong let out a cold laugh. “Who said I was up in the tree to look for the camp?”",
        "The cameraman uncle was taken aback by his words and was momentarily stunned, “…Huh?” "
