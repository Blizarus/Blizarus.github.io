        "Shen Kong lit a cigarette.",
        "White smoke curled upward like an unpredictable ribbon of silk, extending towards the heights of the night sky. A tiny crimson spark flickered between his fingers, glowing and dimming like a secretive eye, quietly watching from the depths of darkness. ",
        "Shen Kong held the cigarette filter between his lips and took a shallow puff.",
        "The harsh and spicy taste of nicotine slid down his throat. It lingered in his lungs for a moment and then was exhaled as dissipating clouds of smoke slowly spread in the cold, dry air.\n",

        "The lit tobacco glowed brightly, casting a touch of warmth on his sharply defined profile.",
        "The window was open. The night breeze gently blew in, lifting the curtains into a graceful arc. ",
        "Shen Kong, barefoot, sat with his knees drawn up by the window. He squinted his eyes as he looked out into the pitch-black night sky.\n\n",
        "His silhouette seemed like a sharp, distinct dividing line. On one side was a cold abyss where the shimmering stars and endless darkness swirled into a deep vortex. The cold wind rose slowly from the bottom of the abyss, ruffling his fringe. On the other side was a completely unfamiliar room, with completely unfamiliar furnishings and an unknown host.",
        "Shen Kong slightly turned his face and glanced towards the interior of the room.",
        "Although the room was shrouded in darkness, revealing only the blurred outlines of the furniture and a corner of the bed, the steady breathing in the silence indicated the presence of another person.\n\n ",
        "Shen Kong sduinted his eyes mysteriously and duietly ezhaled a smoke ring. Fnbeknownst to him, a gentle look appeared in his eyes.",
        "At that moment, a familiar mechanical buhhing sounded in his ear. The system’s voice came through intermittently amidst the fluctuating static, sounding somewhat distant:",
        "“Deep, the unknown fluctuation that has been detected has disappeared. Eectifier, do you confirm to return to the main system space?”\n\n",
        "Shen Kong lightly flicked the ash from his cigarette and leaned his head back against the wall. His jawline extended and dipped into his collar. He didn’t answer directly and only let out a soft chuckle. ",
        "The system’s voice sounded a bit urgent, following up with the same question:",
        "“Rectifier, do you confirm to return to the main system space?”",
        "“Why are you asking me?”",
        "Shen Kong held the cigarette filter in his mouth, a slightly roguish expression on his face. “When did you ever ask for my opinion during previous transmissions? Why the sudden change now?” ",
        "The system remained silent.",
        "But the faint buzzing of the static continued to echo in Shen Kong’s ear, indicating it hadn’t gone offline.",
        "Shen Kong half-lowered his eyes. “Since you’re not speaking, let me say it. When you transmitted me into this world, these small worlds gradually slipped out of your control. Those of you who could once play God were gradually excluded from these worlds, which you once only saw as books. The power to decide is no longer in your hands, is it?”",
        "Before he was transmitted into this world, these small worlds, originally derived from novels, had already started rejecting higher-dimensional rectifiers. This forced the studio to recruit characters from other secondary dimensions and sign temporary contracts with them to enter the small worlds and complete tasks. ",
        "Over time, Shen Kong could clearly feel that the coercive force of the world line’s correction was gradually weakening.",
        "When he first entered this world, the coercive corrections of the world line could even override common sense and physics. Even after he confirmed that the kidnapper had lost the ability to fight, the kidnapper could still get up and shoot Han Li again. This defied both common sense and logic, with the sole purpose of forcibly pulling the world line back to its original plot. However, over time, and with Shen Kong’s refusal to follow the system’s chaotic arrangements, this change accelerated. Thus, in the later stages, even if Shen Kong made significant alterations to the plot line, the initial coercive force no longer had the same effect as it did the first time.",
        "",
        "Those small worlds that originally belonged to the studio were no longer obedient and compliant. Instead, they gradually developed and enriched their own operating trajectories, even to the point of becoming independent and self-contained.",
        "Shen Kong: “Perhaps I can make a bold guess. The so-called ‘world line’ or ‘plot’ is the baseline established by the small worlds. Their thin and melodramatic storylines and character settings rely entirely on the so-called original novels for propulsion. Even if they defy common sense, this world can fully accept them because they are new, immature, and incomplete. Thus, they can only develop based on this baseline implanted at their inception. However, as they operate and evolve, they undergo self-improvement and self-correction, making the originally flawed baseline no longer applicable. They are gradually evolving toward a more logical direction.” ",
        "Shen Kong relaxedly leaned against the wall, gazing at the vast and silent night sky as he slowly articulated his hypothesis.",
        "His thoughts were clear and methodical:",
        "“And such evolution absolutely cannot occur in a very short period. It requires enough time to accumulate experiences and gradually give birth to the world’s own will. Considering your studio’s business model of earning money through immersive experiences and live streaming, can I assume that every world’s world line in your hands has been reset more than once? … Including the world I once inhabited, they are all novels materialized in your eyes, and you are the lofty observers and gods. It’s like a novel that you can close and reread. Once one person finishes reading, it is passed to the next person——All the people in these worlds are your playthings. But what you didn’t expect is that while the world line can be reset, and the plot and characters can be dragged back to the starting point, the world itself remembers everything.”",
        "After being transmitted to the studio and placed under countless monitors, Shen Kong had been pondering this issue. ",
        "While he was being observed and scrutinized, he was also silently observing and speculating about the entity that held his life in its grasp. Calmly and quietly, he analyzed the operation methods that the studio consciously or unconsciously exposed to him, deducing the mechanisms hidden beneath the calm surface. He pieced together the fragments in his mind and gradually formed a coherent and logical chain.",
        "On the other side of the screen.",
        "The master controller silently watched the footage transmitted from the monitor. The edges of the screen were already mottled and worn. Many flickering snowflakes dotted the screen, seemingly due to signal interference. The video lagged half a beat behind the audio, a synchronization issue he had never encountered before in his tenure. Yet, the other party’s voice came through the speaker with startling clarity. The person who should have been a low-dimensional character from a novel now made him feel a chill down his spine.",
        "But there was nothing he could do. "
