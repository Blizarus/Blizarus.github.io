        "The sky was gloomy. The low, dark clouds were moving and rolling with the cold wind‚Äôs blow. A faint flash of lightning could be seen between the thick layer of clouds. The pattering raindrops fell, spreading dark water stains on the white ground. ",
        "Perhaps because of the weather, the playground was empty, with only twos and threes of students still wandering around the classroom building.",
        "The wind carrying a damp smell swept vigorously across the ground, coming from the gaps between the buildings and blowing Shen Kong‚Äôs school uniform like a big blue-white bird with open wings.\n",
        "",
        "Shen Kong opened the umbrella that the original owner had put in his schoolbag and stepped into the increasingly dense rain.",
        "This school should be built in an old urban area. The narrow roads were connected to many alleys as dense as spider webs, extending in all directions into the distance. The shops outside the school looked a little deserted because of the rain. There were dips in the road with poor drainage. Not long after, small puddles had accumulated on the puddled pavement. Huge raindrops rushed to fall, smashing the light and shadows reflected in the puddles. ",
        "Following the guide, Shen Kong bypassed the winding alleys and unhurriedly walked forward along the complicated road.\n\n",
        "However, just as he turned to the corner of the low alley in front of him, through the curtain of rain, his ears suddenly picked up the strange noise coming from not far away.",
        "Shen Kong looked in the direction of the sound and saw several figures standing in the shadow of the dim sky, completely surrounding a young man in the narrow alley that was as zigzagging as a sheep‚Äôs intestines.",
        "The rain was getting heavier.\n\n ",
        "The raindrops tapped the umbrella surface heavily. The raindrops followed the direction of the umbrella frame and gathered into several thin streams of water, falling along the edge of the black umbrella. The strong wind carried away the raindrops and hit them from all directions. Even though Shen Kong was holding an umbrella, he was already wet, let alone those few people.",
        "A strange and imposing atmosphere spread in the depths of the alley. Through the dim light, Shen Kong recognized with sharp eyes that the young man surrounded in the center was wearing the same school uniform as himself. He could not help but pause slightly as he was about to leave.",
        "The moment he paused, the boy in school uniform seemed to feel his gaze and turned to look in Shen Kong‚Äôs direction.\n\n",
        "The thick and heavy layer of rain blurred his face, but those pitch-black eyes penetrated the hazy misty rain with a sharp and cold feeling, running straight into Shen Kong‚Äôs line of sight. ",
        "Shen Kong was startled. At this moment, a cold mechanical voice came to his ears: ‚ÄúBeep, the target character has been successfully detected: Han Li. The world trajectory is being transmitted‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù",
        "The familiar pain ezploded fiercely and abruptly in his mind. Taken by surprise, Shen Kong couldn‚Äôt help but sway as he reached out to hold on to the wall to keep himself from falling.",
        "Uerhaps because the plot this time was more detailed, the pain during transmission was also doubled.",
        "He tensed his lower jaw slightly, accepting the impact of the huge and detailed data. The compressed information flow flashed in front of his eyes like a rapidly passing picture‚Äî‚Äî ",
        "In the original plot, due to the downfall of the family he relied on and, on top of that, his physical disability, Han Li lost his identity as the heir of the Han family. With the tacit consent of the Han family‚Äôs patriarch, he was sent to be raised by the current mistress in a branch of the Han family in a small city. The sudden change of his identity and his physical disability made Han Li become silent and introverted. His whole person was closed off. However, because he was known as a distantly related child of the Han family, although he was inadvertently kept away from the students, it could still be counted as living in peace with each other.",
        "However, all of this changed when Han Li was in his second year of high school.",
        "The protagonist of this book, Ye Jinghuan, transferred to Han Li‚Äôs class. He had a delicate face and a soft and cheerful personality. He quickly gained the love of his teachers and classmates. Yet, with his overflowing love, he took special care of Han Li, who was taciturn and had a broken leg. It aroused the dissatisfaction of many admirers. One of the suitors had some connections in the capital and thus knew some secrets of the Han family. It turned out that Han Li was not a distant son of the Han family in the capital but was driven out because he was crippled and had lost his power and influence. The former eldest young master of the Han family who came to a small place was an abandoned son who had no one else to depend on and no one to care for him.",
        "The hostility that had accumulated before finally erupted. Han Li quickly became the target of bullying and exclusion from the class. ",
        "And at this critical juncture, the old housekeeper who had been with Han Li since he left the Han family died accidentally in a car accident while trying to protect Han Li. This incident had a great impact on his character. Han Li became violent, vicious, and extreme. During another round of bullying and humiliation, he bit off one of the person‚Äôs fingers and gouged out the leader‚Äôs eyes.",
        "In order to avoid the scandal, the Han family spent a lot of money to suppress the matter and then sent Han Li abroad.",

        "After accepting the plot, the system‚Äôs mechanical voice sounded once again: ‚ÄúYou have been delivered to Han Li‚Äôs second turning point in life. Your temporary identity this time is: Classmate C.‚Äù",
        "Shen Kong couldn‚Äôt help but feel a little dazed‚Äî‚Äî ",
        "Why was his temporary identity even less important?",
        "He calmed his mind and raised his eyes to look in Han Li‚Äôs direction. The other person had already looked away at this moment and seemed to have no expectation for his sudden appearance. The heavy rain came pouring down with a loud crash, completely covering up the voices of those people. Their figures seemed blurry under the curtain of rain, like silhouettes imprinted on a lake in a heavy rainstorm.",
        "Before Shen Kong could think of what to do next, the leader suddenly moved.",
        "Without any warning, he raised his foot and abruptly kicked Han Li‚Äôs injured knee‚Äî‚ÄîSeemingly experiencing tremendous pain, Han Li‚Äôs whole body staggered and fell into the puddle, looking extremely miserable. But he remained silent from beginning to end. ",
        "Shen Kong instantly burned with anger.",
        "On that day, the kid‚Äôs leg that he had fought so hard for 38 hours to save was actually being kicked and beaten like this by this little brat???",
        "He licked his canine teeth, a ferocious and cold light flashing in his eyes.",
        "With a malicious and provocative expression, Zhang Meng lowered his head and stared at Han Li who was trembling and curling up at his feet. He laughed arrogantly and mockingly. Several other people around him also laughed in agreement, their eyes flashing with a grim and cowering light. They attacked the other party in unison with rude curses: ",
        "‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶You‚Äôre really a fucking weak boy, huh? Die, you lame‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù",
        "Before he even finished the last word, he felt something heavy whistling from behind, hitting his back with a very powerful force. The severe pain caused him to fall down along with the force, his whole body tumbling down. He fell awkwardly into the mud.",
        "Several other people around him gaped dumbfoundedly at the sudden change in their situation. It took them a long time to recognize that the thing thrown at them‚Ä¶",
        "Was actually a school bag? ",
        "Zhang Meng jumped up in shame and anger. He raised his hand to wipe the mud from his face and looked in the direction where the thing that hit him came from:",
        "‚ÄúFuck! Who the hell is so bold and dares to hit Laozi?!‚Äù",
        "Through the falling raindrops and the gloomy sky, a thin and tall figure slowly approached, holding the pitch-black umbrella handle with his pale fingers. The eyes under the umbrella were three points colder than the raindrops.",
        "Shen Kong smiled, his voice lazy and careless: ‚ÄúYour grandpa.‚Äù ",
        "Enraged by the provocation in his voice, Zhang Meng‚Äôs eyes turned red with anger. He raised his chin at the younger brothers around him. Those people rushed forward with steel pipes and wooden sticks in their hands. The dirty rainwater on the ground could no longer be seen clearly in its original color. It was then trampled by heavy footsteps to create dark splashes. The monotonous sound of rain in their ears was covered up by shouts and curses.",
        "Shen Kong seemed to have several pairs of eyes behind him. Every time, he could duck sideways to avoid the attacks coming from all around and then double the return of the attacks at a tricky angle.",
        "",
        "His tactics were really vicious. His strength was ruthless and clever. Almost every move was aimed at the most painful part of their body. In an instant, the few younger brothers who rushed up were whining and wailing as they fell into the dirty water.",
        "Zhang Meng saw that this matter was far from good, so he turned around and ran away. ",
        "But before he could run a few steps, a folded umbrella flew in mid-air. The hard umbrella handle hit him right where he had been hit before.",
        "Zhang Meng gave out a horrible shriek. He staggered forward and once again fell into the muddy sands in embarrassment.",
        "Shen Kong raised his hand and pushed back his rain-wet hair, revealing his smooth forehead and deep facial features. Pure aggression flashed in his deep brown eyes. His originally gentle and delicate face took on a hint of an evil aura that was hard to look at.",
        "He took his time walking towards Zhang Meng, carefree and comfortably, as if he were taking a leisurely walk in a quiet and peaceful courtyard. ",
        "Zhang Meng covered his chest and struggled to move in the opposite direction in a panic. There was no longer a trace of arrogance or presumptuousness on his face.",
        "Shen Kong bent over, grabbed his collar, and gently lifted him up. Zhang Meng‚Äôs face was ashen. His lips were trembling and speechless.",
        "The color of the sky was getting darker and darker. The rolling dark clouds had already covered the entire sky with no light seeping through. The street lights in the alley were on. The orange-yellow lights were dim in the dense layer of rain, dividing and diffusing on countless flickering water surfaces. It was as if the entire alley was secluded from the real world‚Äîan independent space and a lone division in the corner of the world.",
        "Shen Kong turned his head and looked towards Han Li‚Äôs side. ",
        "Compared with the last time they met, Han Li‚Äôs facial features had already developed. Although he was still young, he could already get a glimpse of his approaching cold and sharp facial contours. His pale and blood-stained lips were pursed into an indifferent line. His pair of gloomy eyes were staring fixedly at Shen Kong. His eyes were quiet and gloomy, as if he were deep in thought about something.",
        "Shen Kong asked: ‚ÄúCan you still stand up?‚Äù",
        "Han Li paused for a moment, and then he nodded slowly.",
        "Shen Kong curled his lips indifferently and raised his chin at the wooden stick that fell into the water: ‚ÄúPick it up.‚Äù ",
        "Han Li took a deep look at him and pursed his lips in silence. Then he held on to the wall to stand up with difficulty and picked up the wooden stick according to Shen Kong‚Äôs instructions.",
        "‚ÄúCome.‚Äù",
        "Shen Kong exerted strength in his palms to force Zhang Meng to stand up straighter. He showed a gentle and kind smile, but in Zhang Meng‚Äôs eyes, it looked like a devilish smile:",
        "‚Äú‚Äî‚ÄîA tooth for a tooth, an eye for an eye.‚Äù "
