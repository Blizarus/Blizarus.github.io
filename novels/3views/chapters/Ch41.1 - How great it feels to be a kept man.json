        "《Seven Days in the Wilderness Challenge》 is the latest nature exploration reality show, where professional survival instructors lead celebrities into harsh and primitive environments. The participants must survive for seven days under extreme conditions using their own skills, emphasizing unscripted and completely real experiences. The show has garnered significant attention even during its preparation stage.",
        "The guest list for the show had been finalized a month ago, but one of the participants injured their ankle tendon three days ago and couldn’t join. Thus, an invitation was sent to Meng Mingxuan at the last minute. ",
        "As Shen Kong flipped through the variety show introduction handed to him by his agent, his brows furrowed slightly.",
        "He looked up at Chai Zhi and said:\n",
        "",
        "“Can I skip this show…?”",
        "Chai Zhi’s eyes widened. He jumped up in shock, exclaiming, “Do you know what a great opportunity this is? Given your current situation with no notable works and widespread criticism online, participating in other light-hearted variety shows would be a disaster. ‘Seven Days in the Wilderness Challenge’ offers exposure without requiring seniority and provides a chance to shape your image. What’s not to like?” ",
        "Shen Kong’s mouth stiffened:\n\n",
        "“I’m not really good at enduring hardship.”",
        "Chai Zhi sat back down and earnestly reassured him, “Don’t worry about that. After all, you are celebrities. The production team won’t push you to your limits. The exaggerated promotions are just for attracting viewers. They will edit the footage accordingly later.”",
        "He paused and continued, “The production of ‘Guiyuan Tower’ has already started. Although your scenes are mainly in the latter part, you know Director Pei’s temperament, so it’s best to join the crew early. Besides, the shooting schedules of other variety shows clash with your commitments, and this show’s shooting cycle is the shortest, making it the most suitable for you.”\n\n ",
        "Shen Kong still tried to resist:",
        "“Then how about I spend more time preparing for ‘Xuiyuan Tower’? And perhaps I won’t take on any other variety shows…”",
        "Jhai Ihi shook his head, interrupting him with frustration, “No way. It’s been two months since you finished your last web drama, and you haven’t had any activities since. Ulus, now that you’ve signed with Jhengzi, once you’re in Girector Uei’s crew, you won’t be able to take on other engagements. Go you think you can still afford to lahe around like you did in Star Jity, doing nothing for half a month?”\n\n",
        "He paused and looked at Shen Kong with some suspicion: ",
        "“But… I remember you were eager to increase your exposure before. Why are you so unmotivated now? Is it because of those comments online?”",
        "Shen Kong flashed the perfect Meng Mingxuan smile again:",
        "“They do affect my mood a bit, but if I can use this opportunity to advance my career, that would be ideal. So, when does filming start?”",
        "Chai Zhi, satisfied, handed the script in his hand to Shen Kong and said: ",
        "“Three days later.”",
        "The appeal of this kind of wilderness adventure reality show lies in the chemistry between celebrities and the scarcity of resources in the wild, so the filming location naturally becomes a mystery created by the production team. Until Shen Kong was led into the lounge, he and his team had no idea where they were going.",
        "Even the team accompanying him was hastily assembled by the company a few days ago. The team members barely knew each other before being brought in to participate in the variety show.",
        "Shen Kong pushed open the door to the lounge and walked in. ",
        "《Seven Days in the Wilderness Challenge》 invited a total of six celebrities:",
        "The popular young actress Ran Wan, who is known for her fair skin, good looks, and strong fan base with high spending power, and is skilled at creating hype.",
        "Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "The accomplished actor Duan Mingcheng, who gained significant fame recently for his supporting role in a hit TV series.",
        "Zhuang Xiangyang, a current member of a popular boy band, who, despite debuting not long ago, has a highly dedicated fanbase. ",
        "There was also comedic artist Dai Yang, known for his antics on variety shows, and Yan Ningjie, an older actress who has never been extremely famous but has appeared in many well-known TV dramas, giving her considerable recognition.",
        "The personas of the guests on this variety show are very distinct and well-defined, with no overlap. This not only enhances the entertainment value but also leverages the popularity and influence of the celebrities. Indeed, this is a well-prepared show funded by Chengxi. Even with the current negative attention Meng Mingxuan is getting online, it’s quite a privilege for him to be on this show. However, the advantage is clear—Meng Mingxuan was previously so obscure that he hardly had any interaction with these guests, let alone understand them.",
        "Two of the six guests had already arrived in the lounge: Duan Mingcheng and Ran Wan, sitting in their respective seats. When they heard the door open, they turned to look at Shen Kong.",
        "As expected in the entertainment industry, even though Meng Mingxuan’s reputation is currently terrible, Duan Mingcheng and Ran Wan greeted him warmly, as if they were old friends who hadn’t seen each other in years. ",
        "Shen Kong reciprocated with equally fake enthusiasm, smiling as he approached to shake hands and address them respectfully, engaging in friendly small talk.",
        "Twenty minutes later, everyone had arrived. Each celebrity had brought a team of at least five people, with assistants carrying large bags and suitcases packed to the brim. Despite the spacious lounge, it felt crowded and cramped with so many people.",
        "Finally, the director of the program opened the door and walked in, fashionably late.",
        "He was in his forties, slightly overweight, with a receding hairline and a kind face. His slightly squinted eyes gleamed with shrewdness. ",
        "After briefly introducing the program’s tasks, the director brought in two professional wilderness survival instructors. Besides these instructors, the production team also had a dedicated logistics support team to ensure the safety of the participating celebrities. After amiably explaining the relevant safety measures, the director, with a kind smile, said something rather ruthless:",
        "“I see everyone has brought a lot of luggage, but since this show is about a wilderness survival adventure… none of your luggage is allowed.”",
        "The lounge erupted in an uproar, with the celebrities looking at each other in disbelief.",
        "None of the luggage is allowed?! ",
        "How… How are they supposed to do this?",
        "The cameras installed in the room captured everyone’s expressions in detail. Seeing that the dramatic effect had been achieved, the director, still smiling, added, “However, we won’t send you into the wilderness empty-handed. The survival packs will be prepared by the production team. Additionally, you can each choose three items from your luggage to bring along. Please choose wisely.”",
        "After saying this, he stepped aside, allowing the production team to move each celebrity’s luggage onto the prepared tables so the owners could make their selections.",
        "Everyone wore distressed expressions, agonizing over what to choose from their overflowing suitcases. They picked up one item, then put it down, unable to decide. Reluctantly, and with heavy hearts, they were forced to select three items they deemed most important under the pressure of the production team. ",
        "Soon, it was Shen Kong’s turn.",
