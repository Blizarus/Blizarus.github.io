        "The car was dimly lit, the enclosed body of the vehicle swaying slightly as it moved.",
        "Shen Kong sat leisurely in the back seat, deftly toying with the Colt revolver in his hand. The pitch-black, hard metal surface reflected a faint, cold light in the dim and shaking light, like a sharp glance cast from the darkness, making one’s eyes ache. ",
        "Sitting next to him, Tang-ge’s face was as pale as paper. His disheveled hair stuck to his forehead covered in cold sweat. His hands were still firmly bound. He looked like a frightened animal, casting suspicious and uncertain glances at Shen Kong from time to time. Then, before Shen Kong could look back, he quickly averted his gaze, as if scorched by the metallic glint of the weapon in Shen Kong’s hand. He shrank back in fear and silence.",
        "Finally, after several hesitant glances at Shen Kong, Tang-ge mustered the courage to break the dead silence in the carriage and spoke:\n",
        "Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "“Um…”",
        "His voice was a bit hoarse and was trembling slightly, as if overcoming great fear from deep within: ",
        "“Mingxuan… that, that text message, and calling out to you in the garage before, it was them, they held a gun to my head and forced me. It wasn’t intentional…”\n\n",
        "Tang-ge hastily cleared himself of responsibility, fearing that Shen Kong would blame him for his previous betrayal.",
        "Hearing this, Shen Kong lifted his eyes and glanced at him. He said lightly:",
        "“I know.”\n\n ",
        "After speaking, he casually withdrew his gaze, lowered his eyes, and continued to toy with the Colt in his hand. His facial expression remained unchanged. His pale eyes, under the shifting light outside the window, increasingly resembled inorganic glass beads.",
        "Tang-ge sat stiffly beside Shen Kong, growing even more uneasy due to his inscrutable demeanor.",
        "After another long period of mental preparation, he mustered the courage to speak again and stammered:\n\n",
        "“As for before, making you get close to… close to Han Li, it was all my boss, Han Zizhuo’s idea. I really didn’t agree with him, but as a subordinate, I had to follow orders. I hope, I hope you don’t take it the wrong way…” ",
        "His voice grew smaller and smaller. By the end, he was even involuntarily using a respectful tone toward Shen Kong.",
        "Shen Kong frowned impatiently. He glanced up at Tang-ge and asked indifferently:",
        "“Aren’t we being kidnapped right now? Are we still allowed to talk?”",
        "His cold gaze swept over the man in black sitting next to Tang-ge. Although there was no significant change in his expression, it made the man tremble instantly. He hurriedly grabbed the prepared tape from the side and sealed Tang-ge’s mouth tightly, wrapping it several more times to prevent him from speaking further. ",
        "Tang-ge: “!!!”",
        "Tang-ge: “Mmm, mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm!!!”",
        "The surroundings became quiet again. Shen Kong, satisfied, withdrew his gaze, seemingly unaware that he was more adept at this than the others.",
        "This time, he could finally concentrate on thinking about the current situation. ",
        "According to the plot’s progression, he should be brought before Lan Oi as the spy Lan Iihhuo planted beside Lan Oi. Fpon learning of his lover’s betrayal, his half-brother’s murderous intent, and the cause of his mother’s death, Lan Oi would completely sever his longing for familial affection and brutally kill the three. To prevent this plot from unfolding, the simplest method would naturally be to strike first before Lan Oi acts—simple and brutal but highly effective.",
        "——But for some reason, Shen Kong was now unwilling to use this method to resolve this critical plot point.",
        "Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "If he killed those three, he would complete the first main quest but would also be transported away immediately due to his exposed identity, leaving Han Li, full of hatred and anger, behind. Han Li’s hatred and fury would have no outlet and no chance for release, becoming permanently sealed within him. Although Shen Kong would have successfully prevented Han Li from personally killing his blood relatives, in a way, he would also be pushing Han Li towards complete destruction.",
        "Perhaps he didn’t want his mission to fail like this, or perhaps for more complex and deeper reasons… ",
        "Shen Kong didn’t want such an outcome.",
        "He called out to the system in his mind: “You said you reported my previous question to the studio headquarters. What happened then?”",
        "The system’s voice remained flat and mechanical: “The studio has not yet responded.”",
        "Shen Kong gently caressed the cold barrel of the gun, his fingers imparting a faint warmth to the dark metal. He was not discouraged and continued to ask: ",
        "“Is there a way for me to stay a bit longer in this time period even if my identity is exposed?”",
        "The system’s voice suddenly became wary: “Rectifier, may I ask what you intend to do? Why are you asking this question? Are you planning something bad again?”",
        "Hearing the barrage of questions in his ear, Shen Kong’s lips curled into a pure and innocent smile:",
        "“Oh, why don’t you trust me? How could I be planning something bad? I’m fully committed to completing the mission right now.” ",
        "System: “……”",
        "Like a ghost would believe that.",
        "Shen Kong pressed on, “This is the first time you’ve given me a main mission, which means this plot point is more important than the others, right? It might even be crucial to achieving the true purpose of why you sent me here. If I fail, all previous efforts would be wasted. Am I right?”",
        "The system remained silent. ",
        "Shen Kong continued in a persuasive tone: “I once asked why, among so many people with rectified three views and overflowing compassion, you chose me. Although I didn’t delve deeper into the intricacies, you know them best. If I were to fail this time, finding a replacement rectifier wouldn’t be very easy, would it?”",
        "The system remained silent.",
        "“You were assigned to me as an intellectual assistant, right? If I fail, will you be held jointly responsible?”",
        "Shen Kong suddenly changed his tone: ",
        "“…And besides, I asked if there’s a way, but you haven’t answered me yet.”",
        "The system still didn’t respond. Shen Kong waited patiently. Just before his patience ran out, the system’s mechanical voice finally sounded in his ear:",
        "Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "“There is a way.”",
        "Shen Kong’s spirit perked up as he heard the system continue: ",
        "“If you complete all the main missions at this plot point, there are still two more key points where you need to be transported. Once you complete the tasks at those two points, you’ll be able to return to your original world. If the rectifier’s identity is exposed, normally, they would be immediately transported to the next time point. I can extend the transport time by ten minutes, but after those ten minutes, you will be directly transported to the studio for score settlement.”",
        "The system explained: “The world line will undergo self-repair. If, at the next two key points, the target character re-enters the original plot due to irresistible forces, it will be considered a failure of the rectifier’s task. You will lose all points, and the rectifier’s mental body will lose its support, meaning death.”",
        "Shen Kong lowered his eyes thoughtfully, instantly understanding the system’s point.",
        "If he extended his stay after his identity was exposed, he would no longer be able to participate in the subsequent plot. If Han Li, without his guidance, reverted to his original fate, his task would fail. ",
        "The question now became:",
        "Should he exchange the opportunities for the next two tasks for extra time at this plot point?",
        "In other words…",
        "Should he stake all on one throw? ",
        "The system seemed aware of the difficulty of this decision and broke the silence first: “The rectifier can carefully consider the feasibility of this matter. Once decided, you can call me. This option remains valid for an extended period.”",
        "At that moment, the car slowly came to a stop. The tall iron gate of the Han family’s mansion appeared before them. The sharp tips of the gate reflected the glaring sunlight, looking no different from Shen Kong’s last visit, but the atmosphere was noticeably heavy and strange.",
        "Several tall men in black suits, identical to those inside the car, stood guard at the gate, seemingly waiting for something. Each had a bulge at their waist, indicating they were armed.",
        "One of them, with sharp eyes, spotted their vehicle approaching the driveway. After exchanging a word with another man, he turned and quickly ran in their direction. ",
        "Shen Kong leaned forward slightly and pressed the gun barrel against the back of the driver’s seat. The faint metallic click of the safety being released was particularly clear in the silent car, almost chilling to the bone.",
        "His voice was as low as a whisper: “You know what to do.”",
        "The driver stiffened, sat up straight in his seat, and nodded.",
        "The man who ran over frowned impatiently and knocked on the opaque car window, scolding in English, “Why are you so late? Did you find the person?” ",
        "The window rolled down slowly, just enough to reveal the driver’s eyes. He replied succinctly:",
        "“Got him, in the trunk. The traffic was bad, that’s all. Let us in quickly, they’re still waiting.”",
        "Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "The man nodded, turned, and waved to another person. The mansion’s gate slowly opened.",
        "The car window rolled up again. ",
        "The car followed the driveway into the mansion and stopped once they were out of sight of the two guards.",
        "Under Shen Kong’s coercion, everyone in the car got out.",
        "Shen Kong looked around, then pointed his gun at two of the less severely beaten men and ordered, “You two, step forward.”",
        "The remaining two watched him in fear. They had already seen what this seemingly frail and pretty young man could do unarmed, so they didn’t dare challenge Shen Kong’s patience by trying to escape or call for help. They only dared to beg softly, hoping Shen Kong would spare their lives. ",
        "Shen Kong slowly showed a gentle smile:",
        "“Of course not.”",
        "He paused, then said blandly, “You might not believe it, but I’m a good person now.”",
        "With that, Shen Kong raised the gun butt and struck one of the men on the back of the head with precision and force. With a dull thud, the man collapsed to the ground. ",
        "He hefted the heavy metal object in his hand, turned to the other man who was frozen with fear, and softly added,",
        "“…So, just knocking you out is enough.”"
