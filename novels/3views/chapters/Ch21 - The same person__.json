        "On the third floor of the Casino.",
        "Wang Ruicheng picked up the ashtray on the table and smashed it down heavily. ",
        "Countless sharp and translucent glass shards splattered, falling heavily onto the ground.",
        "The room was a mess.\n",

        "At this moment, several careful knocks came through the door.",
        "Wang Ruicheng, feeling irritable, scratched his hair and shouted: “Come in.” ",
        "One of his men cautiously pushed the door open and walked in. He stood outside the door with his eyes downcast, not daring to raise his eyes and look at the chaotic scene in the private room as if a tornado had passed through. He stammered: “That, Master Wang… We still can’t contact them, and we’ve searched all over the place, but they all said they didn’t see them coming out of PUZZEL…”\n\n",
        "Before he could finish speaking, Wang Ruicheng’s anger flared up again. He picked up the only cup left on the table and threw it heavily towards the door.",
        "His subordinate subconsciously shrank his shoulders and did not dare to hide. He only dared to stand firmly in place.",
        "Wang Ruicheng angrily paced around the private room, his fat face flushing red, the flesh on his cheeks seemingly trembling along with his intense emotions: “Can’t find them? Can’t find them!? Then keep looking for them, keep contacting them! If my third cousin finds out that I secretly used his connections to enter that damned club, not only will it be exposed that we haven’t found Cheng Chen yet, but you guys will be in trouble too! Understand?”\n\n ",
        "His subordinate standing at the doorway nodded in fear and hastily ran away.",
        "Inside the private room, silence once again prevailed. Wang Ruicheng fell heavily on the sofa like a deflated rubber ball, wiping his face tiredly and regretfully.",
        "In fact, he acted impulsively. Although he made conscious efforts to send someone to bring back Cheng Chen’s father, he didn’t think much beyond that…\n\n",
        "As a result, this little bit of carelessness led to a catastrophe. Not only did he fail to bring back the person, but even his own men were detained. ",
        "His cell phone suddenly rang.",
        "Wang Ruicheng looked at the caller ID, his eyes instantly darkening. He hesitated for a long time before finally answering the phone in despair:",
        "“…Hello? Third cousin?”",
        ". ",
        "Lan Oi stood at the school gate, lowering his head and playing with the mobile phone in his hand.",
        "The bright sunlight enveloped him in a faint halo. Lis school uniform coat was draped over his arms, and he was only wearing a lined white shirt. Lis figure became even taller and more slender, causing the girls passing by him to involuntarily glance at him again and again. Their eyes were directed in his direction, either ezplicitly or secretly.",
        "He kept his eyes down, seemingly oblivious to everything around him, just immersed in his own thoughts.",
        "On the dimming screen of the phone, a text message from an unknown contact showed that it had been read. ",
        "——PUZZEL’s intruders confessed their mastermind.",
        "As expected, they were indeed sent by the Chengdong Casino, where Han Li went to negotiate cooperation that day. According to one of them, their boss was alarmed and urgently dispatched them after seeing several thugs who looked like they had been badly beaten. He instructed them to bring Cheng Chen’s father with them, under the pretext of convincing him to come out to see his son who wasn’t doing well in school, and to prevent his classmates from getting suspicious.",

        "Han Li now controls two types of resources, one visible in the form of PUZZEL’s business expansion and the other covertly associated with Lin Ziyu. He acted cautiously and discreetly, keeping both identities tightly concealed. It was obvious that the newly emerging forces in Chengdong had discovered a loophole; hence, they released rumors to test him, but they didn’t expect to be thwarted by a few reckless thugs.",
        "As for Cheng Chen, he appeared at the casino on the same day as Han Li and was later found to be the person who rescued himself from the thugs before. Therefore, it was not surprising that he was mistakenly thought to be on Han Li’s side. ",
        "Considering what Cheng Zekang mentioned about the account book, Han Li had a vague guess in his mind.",
        "Many casinos have some undisclosed rules, even those operating legally. They would mix in some rigged tables among regular ones to generate substantial gray income. Therefore, they usually keep two sets of books, one legitimate and the other for recording these unreported gray incomes.",
        "Cheng Chen’s gambling skills were astounding, and since he was considered one of his subordinates, the casino operators naturally assumed he was sent to find those watered tables and calculate their gray accounts through algorithms. That was why they were so nervous around him.",
        "The phone in his hand vibrated twice: ",
        "“What are you going to do next?”",
        "Han Li slightly narrowed his eyes, tapping lightly on the screen with his finger:",
        "“Look for the account book.”",
        "Since you're so afraid of the account book falling into my hands, then I must find it. ",
        "At that moment, a commotion arose from the crowd beside him. Han Li turned off the screen and looked in the direction of the commotion.",
        "He saw the transfer student who had just transferred to their class today walking straight through the crowd towards him. His slender figure resembled a newly sprouted bamboo shoot, with his features beautifully delicate under the setting sun. His cheeks and hair looked soft, evoking an uncontrollable sense of tenderness.",
        "…Cheng Chen actually likes this type?",
        "Han Li was somewhat absent-minded. ",
        "By now, Ye Jinghuan had already reached him, raising his palm-sized face to look at him with his cat-like eyes blinking quickly. He seemed a bit embarrassed as he apologetically whispered, “Um… this morning, I didn’t mean to poke at your sore spot. I’m really sorry. Can you forgive me?”",
        "Han Li furrowed his brows, unable to control the images from this morning filling his mind——",
        "In a noisy classroom, a refined and handsome young man with a slightly bowed, thin back, a fair side face still bearing faint red marks, and narrow double-lidded eyes lazily glanced at him, casually commenting in a husky voice: “He seems pretty good. He should have a good personality.”",
        "If he remembered correctly, this was the first time since he met Cheng Chen that he had taken the initiative to make a positive comment on something. ",
        "An unspeakable rage suddenly surged in Han Li’s heart, his expression instantly darkening. Dark thoughts arose in his mind, swirling and tightening around his slender and cold body, hissing whispers in his ears, murmuring, each word seemingly dripping with thick and dark venom.",
        "And Ye Jinghuan standing in front of him was still annoyingly chattering:",
        "",
        "“…Classmate, if you don’t mind, we can be friends…”",
        "Before he could do anything, his peripheral vision keenly caught Cheng Chen’s figure just walking out of the school gate. ",
        "Some extreme thoughts in his mind seemed to be instantly appeased. Han Li didn’t even bother to look at Ye Jinghuan standing in front of him, indifferently turning around and leaving.",
        "Ye Jinghuan was shocked. He really didn’t expect Han Li to have such an attitude. He subconsciously reached out and grabbed his sleeve:",
        "“Hey, what’s up with you…”",
        "The lame young man in front of him was abruptly halted by his pull. Coldly glancing sideways, his pitch-black eyes were like stars on a cold night dipped in ice water, staring down at him as if he were just an inanimate object. Ye Jinghuan couldn’t help but feel cold all over, rooted in place. ",
        "Before he could come back to his senses, he heard Han Li say indifferently:",
        "“Let go.”",
        "Ye Jinghuan loosened his fingers in a daze.",
        "As if touched by something dirty, Han Li lowered his eyes, lightly patted the non-existent dust off his sleeve with his fingers, then turned and left without looking back. ",
        "The gazes of the surrounding crowd flickered over, both overtly and secretly, as if invisible spotlights were shining on him. Ye Jinghuan’s cheeks couldn’t help but flush red and hot with embarrassment. Half ashamed and resentful and half at a loss, he lowered his head to avoid the gaze of others around him, his slender white fingers gripping the straps of his bag tightly as he turned and ran away quickly.",
        "As he ran, he thought with shame and resentment to himself: He would never take the initiative to deal with this rude person again!",
        "Meanwhile, Han Li, who had already walked far away, unconcernedly quickened his pace, limping over to Shen Kong’s side.",
        "Shen Kong slung his bag over his shoulder, leisurely walking out of the school gate. When he looked up and saw Han Li, he was somewhat surprised: ",
        "“What are you doing here?”",
        "“I thought since we’re going to meet at your house anyway, it’s better to wait for you after school.”",
        "“How long have you been waiting?”",
        "Han Li followed behind him, shaking his head: “Not long, I just came out too.” ",
        "Shen Kong reached out and pressed his shoulders, incredibly stiff from sleeping all day. His neck made crisp bone-on-bone sounds as he rotated it. He lazily stretched his legs and said: “Okay, let’s go.”",
        "Han Li’s indifferent face, which had just kept people at a distance of 1,000 li, now had a slight smile on it. The sharp lines of his face softened, making him look like a gentle boy next door. He quickened his pace to catch up with Shen Kong, and the two quickly disappeared from the crowd’s sight.",

        "The onlookers who had watched the whole thing from beginning to end were shocked to see the two of them leaving, almost daring not to believe their own eyes.",
        "Was that really the same person as just now? ",
        "KEIGHTY: Hello, guys. I made a mistake and scheduled 3VIEWS today instead of tomorrow QAQ Please treat this as an advance chapter instead. Hence, there will be no chapter update tomorrow since it’s already posted in advance. Sorry for the inconvenience! 🙇🏻‍♀️"
