        "“…What?”",
        "Shen Kong was stunned. After spending half a second more processing the information he heard, he squinted his eyes dangerously: ",
        "“Are these people hired by you?”",
        "Han Li stared intently at Shen Kong above him. He nodded, his expression even somewhat cheerful.\n",

        "Shen Kong furrowed his brows in utter confusion and asked, “…Do you have some sort of problem?”",
        "Han Li’s pitch-black eyes gazed unwaveringly at Shen Kong above him, as if pondering for a moment. Then he seriously replied, ",
        "“Does lovesickness count?”\n\n",
        "Shen Kong: “………………”",
        "At that moment, the dense sound of footsteps in the hallway suddenly fell silent. It didn’t take much thought to realize that they were armed and blocking the door. Due to the total annihilation of the previous team, they became cautious and didn’t dare to break in before figuring out the situation inside. This calm before the storm was only temporary. Once orders were issued through their headsets, they would charge in without hesitation.",
        "Now was not the time for small talk.\n\n ",
        "Shen Kong stood up, then reached out to pull Han Li from the ground, urgently asking, “Do you have any other exits here?”",
        "Han Li nodded slightly, then limped a bit as he walked toward the desk.",
        "He entered a few numbers on the safe embedded in the wall. With a beep, a distinct shape recessed into the wall beside it. He pushed it, revealing a hidden door behind the wall.\n\n",
        "Amidst the crackling sound in their earpieces came the order to breach the door. ",
        "Shen Kong’s expression turned grim. He grabbed Han Li and slipped into the narrow, dark space behind the door. The hidden door closed behind them, blocking out the sudden sound of the door breaking outside.",
        "The hidden door was clearly designed for a single person, but now, with two normal-sized adult men squeezed inside, it became a bit cramped.",
        "Shen Kong listened intently to the noises outside the hidden door, then whispered in a barely audible voice:",
        "“Where does this hidden door lead to?” ",
        "There was no immediate response. Shen Kong, puzzled, couldn’t help but turn his head slightly, only to feel his lips inadvertently brush against a soft patch of skin.",
        "He froze.",
        "It was only then that Shen Kong realized how close they were in this confined space.",
        "Their chests were pressed against each other, trapped in the semi-enclosed space formed by walls on both sides and above them. In the darkness, they could only hear the rhythm of each other’s breathing and heartbeats. They could even feel the contours of the other person’s body and the tension in their muscles. The heat generated by their exertion spread through their thin clothes, making the entire space almost unbearably hot. ",
        "Shen Kong, feeling somewhat uncomfortable, tried to lean back, but the wall behind him prevented any movement.",
        "Le had been this close to others during missions before. They huddled together under eztreme circumstances, perhaps to prevent heat loss or to minimihe their ezposed area. Lowever, none of those times had ever felt as unsettling as this.",
        "Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "The distance between them was so close that they could feel every movement of each other’s bodies. Shen Kong’s retreat was naturally included.",
        "Han Li suddenly pressed closer. ",
        "Cold, dry lips with hot breath pressed tightly against Shen Kong’s. The surge of adrenaline and male hormones made both men equally aggressive. Shen Kong raised his hand to grab Han Li’s neck and forcibly pulled him away. He whispered through gritted teeth in his ear, “Don’t go crazy.”",
        "Han Li laughed hoarsely and obediently tilted his head back. He leaned against the wall and said softly:",
        "“Seven years.”",
        "Shen Kong was stunned, instantly understanding the implication in Han Li’s words. ",
        "Han Li’s voice was very calm, without much emotion: “I fulfilled your request, but you never showed up even once.”",
        "Shen Kong didn’t know how to respond.",
        "Han Li’s soft neck was tightly pressed against Shen Kong’s palm. He could feel Han Li’s Adam’s apple moving up and down as he spoke, the vibration of his vocal cords, and even the frequency of the arterial pulse and the faint sound of blood flowing under his skin. All these tiny details were magnified in the dark, narrow space and vividly transmitted to Shen Kong’s fingertips. It was so fragile, vibrant, and full of life.",
        "In the dim, weak light, Shen Kong could see the other’s eyes glimmering in the darkness. The vibration of Han Li’s voice came through the neck beneath his palm. Shen Kong couldn’t tell if he was hearing with his ears or if the sound was being transmitted through their closely pressed bodies: ",
        "“You might not know this, but ever since I met you a long time ago, I’ve had a very vivid dream. The world in that dream is very similar to reality, with the only difference being… you aren’t there. After comparing that dream and reality, I realized that you always appear at pivotal moments in my life——I even started to imagine that perhaps you were meant for me.”",
        "Han Li raised his hand to grasp Shen Kong’s wrist. His cold fingertips gently traced over the back of Shen Kong’s hand, his fingers, and his fingertips. His deep voice was almost tender:",
        "“See, I was right. You really came for me.”",
        "Shen Kong turned his hand to grab Han Li’s mischievous fingers: ",
        "“Now that you’ve seen me, cancel the mission.”",
        "Han Li laughed: “If it could be undone by myself, it wouldn’t be called a deadlock. The payment has already been anonymously prepaid through an offshore account and can’t be canceled. This organization’s international completion rate is one hundred percent. They won’t stop until the target is dead.”",
        "Shen Kong: “……”",
        "After a long silence, he finally asked in disbelief: ",
        "“What if I didn’t show up?”",
        "Han Li tightly interlocked his fingers with Shen Kong’s and continued nonchalantly, “Then I would have lost the bet.”",
        "Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "He paused, then continued, “But it doesn’t matter. My will was notarized years ago, and the distribution of my shares and assets has already been arranged. All my property will go to a charitable foundation after my death——See, I’m doing good deeds even after I’m gone.”",
        "Han Li’s voice lifted at the end, as if seeking praise. ",
        "Shen Kong didn’t know how he felt inside.",
        "The strange feeling he had deliberately ignored when he saw the form at the studio headquarters resurfaced.",
        "It was as if a sharp knife was prying open his heart and pouring something highly corrosive inside, the dissolving process both scorching and painful——Shen Kong wanted to rage, to break Han Li’s bones and tear his flesh, to make him bleed and hurt as he did. But another strange emotion held back his actions, pulling him back from the brink of violence.",
        "Shen Kong ground his molars and suppressed the terrifying emotions churning within him. ",
        "Now was definitely not the time to dig up old grievances.",
        "Shen Kong pried Han Li’s fingers apart and began to focus on thinking about feasible strategies.",
        "Although the sounds outside the hidden door had disappeared, it was clear that there was no second exit within. Given that this was a professional organization, they would certainly leave people guarding the entrance and exit. Moreover, there were at least two snipers outside the building. This made their current situation awkward and precarious. Shen Kong furrowed his brow and asked, “What about your men? Can you contact them?”",
        "Han Li glanced down at Shen Kong’s withdrawn hand: ",
        "“They disbanded and reorganized seven years ago. Although the connections are still there, but…”",
        "Han Li paused, then continued lightly, “But my personal phone has been tapped and tracked, so I just left it on the desk and didn’t take it.”",
        "Shen Kong suddenly had a bad feeling: “How could your personal phone be compromised? What about your security measures?”",
        "The next second, his guess was confirmed——”I leaked it.” ",
        "Shen Kong: “……”",
        "This man really didn’t leave himself any way out.",
        "Shen Kong took a deep breath and directed his gaze to the passage extending into the darkness beside them. He raised an eyebrow: “What about here? Where does it lead?”",
        "“To the garden.” ",
        "“Does anyone else know about this route?”",
        "Han Li shook his head. In such a confined space, Shen Kong could even feel the tickle of Han Li’s hair brushing against his chin. “This passage was secretly designed and built. You won’t find it on any blueprints.”",
        "",
        "Although this exit was still within the danger zone, at least there wouldn’t be snipers and action teams lying in wait. Plus, the other side likely hadn’t yet realized that their communication device had been stolen, so the chance of success was quite high.",
        "——At this point, they couldn’t ask for too much. ",
        "Shen Kong nodded and succinctly said:",
        "“Stay close.”",
        "With that, he deftly sidestepped Han Li and was the first to step into the dark, narrow passage.",
        "Han Li watched Shen Kong’s back, almost blending into the darkness. His dark eyes narrowed slightly. The aggression and possessiveness he suppressed earlier instantly overflowed, like dark waves rolling with dangerous tides. He blinked, suppressed the deep emotions in his eyes, and then followed Shen Kong forward. ",
        "About ten minutes later, the passage came to an end.",
        "The garden was silent. The night wind rustled the grass and trees. The search orders continued in the earpiece, still looking for Han Li’s whereabouts. After carefully and cautiously scouting the area, Shen Kong’s expression grew slightly more serious.",
        "Although it seemed calm, there were patrol guards at several exits and on the main road.",
        "The surveillance cameras appeared to have been cut off long ago, making this area a hotbed for instability. ",
        "Shen Kong quickly observed the layout of the garden and turned to instruct Han Li to wait here for a moment. Before Han Li could stop him, Shen Kong disappeared into the dense foliage like a fish slipping into water. His movements were so agile that they made no sound.",
        "Han Li’s face was somber as he slowly retracted his hand that lingered in midair.",
        "Three minutes later.",
        "The piercing sound of the fire alarm echoed throughout the building. The gala in the hall was instantly disrupted. Panicked guests and servants hurriedly rushed out. The commotion quickly shattered the garden’s tranquility and concealment. Frightened members of high society began to inquire about what was happening or whether there was a fire, while the drivers on standby in the street drove up to the entrance. ",
        "Creating chaos is the easiest way to disappear.",
        "Han Li waited quietly.",
        "Suddenly, there was a slight rustling in the bushes in front of him. A tall man lightly leaped out from the intertwined branches and leaves. The air seemed to be filled with the scent of steel and blood, with a hint of gunpowder. His sharp eyebrows and eyes appeared indifferent and distant under the moonlight, like a deadly and dangerous cold weapon, yet he extended his hand:",
        "“Let’s go.” ",
        "As if bewitched, Han Li was momentarily dazed, then he raised his hand and grasped the hand hanging in the air.",
        "As if he had found a treasure.",
        "",
        "The author has something to say: This pair is probably the most fitting CP for that S&M dynamic I’ve ever written."
