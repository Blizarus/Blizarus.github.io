        "The rain outside the window was still falling continuously, tapping continuously on the window of the room, making a monotonous and lulling sound. ",
        "Under the yellowish light in the room, Shen Kong lowered his head to examine his upper body.",
        "This body was thin and pale. It had obviously not seen much sunlight. The young man’s tight and smooth skin was covered with protruding ribs. There were not many real powerful muscles from his chest to his lower abdomen. At first glance, it seemed as though his shoulders or hands couldn’t carry or lift anything, with weak limbs and gentleness, far different from the kidnapper B last time.\n",
        "",
        "His physical fitness this time was really not that good. After just a few simple steps, he could clearly feel that he couldn't do as much as he would like to in this body.",
        "His victory just now basically relied on his skillful strength and his experience of walking on the line of life and death, rather than the strength of this body itself. ",
        "Shen Kong gently shifted his shoulder blades and furrowed his brows slightly——although he was already very careful, he was still inevitably bruised. His shoulders and the side of his abdomen showed dazzling blue marks, looking particularly shocking on his pale skin.\n\n",
        "Fortunately, they were all flesh wounds.",
        "Shen Kong simply wiped the medicated oil found in the room on the wound and then put on his clothes.",
        "At this moment, the bathroom door not far away was pushed open, and Han Li, covered in steam, walked out. His wet black hair stuck tightly to his cheeks, softening his cold facial contours.\n\n ",
        "He was still wearing the old clothes that Shen Kong took out of the closet. Fortunately, they were of similar stature, so it didn’t look out of place.",
        "Han Li raised his eyes to look at Shen Kong and said in a low voice:",
        "“About before, thank you so much.”\n\n",
        "Shen Kong raised his eyelids. He pointed lazily at the stool beside the bed and ordered: “Sit down.” ",
        "Lan Oi obediently limped forward and compliantly sat down on the chair.",
        "“Uull up your trouser legs.”",
        "Lan Oi paused for a moment. Le looked at Shen Kong intently and then bent down to slowly roll up his trouser legs.",
        "——Mrom his ankles with protruding bones, to his slender calves, to the black and swollen knees. ",
        "There were three crooked scars running across his knees, lying like ugly centipedes on the purple-red wounds. They were pushed up by the swollen and congested skin, making them look like some kind of terrifying living thing.",
        "Shen Kong’s eyebrows furrowed slightly. He remembered the doctor saying that Han Li’s legs would have sequelae, but now it seemed that it was more serious than he thought.",
        "On top of that, it was a rainy day today. He had been severely wounded before, but Han Li actually did not say a word from beginning to end. He never asked Shen Kong to walk slower but limped behind him, making Shen Kong a little surprised. It seemed that this kid’s endurance was pretty good, at least much better than the pathetic shut-in kid in the previously transmitted plot.",
        "He poured the medicated oil into his palms, rubbed his hands together skillfully, and then pressed them on Han Li’s knees. ",
        "The scorching palm was as hot as charcoal fire, pressing against the cold and moist skin without warning. Han Li shuddered slightly from the heat and subconsciously pursed his lips.",
        "Shen Kong said in a deep voice: “Don’t move.”",
        "",
        "As he started moving, Han Li only felt that the pain in his knee became more intense, but the deep chill soaked deep in his bones lessened, as if his entire calf was being scorched by the hot, blazing, and fiery pain. The entire palm of his hand was igniting. Heat began to radiate from deep within the skin, ironing the injured and cold bones and tendons warmly and appropriately.",
        "Han Li pursed his lips and clenched his fingers slightly, his entire calf beginning to tense up subconsciously. ",
        "Shen Kong skillfully pressed the bones under his skin, his nimble fingertips skillfully passing through the gaps between the bones. Then he pressed the burning medicated oil that was heated by his body temperature into the surface of the skin.",
        "It only lasted two or three minutes, but it seemed as if half a century had passed. Han Li felt that his back was getting hot and sweating. The corners of his forehead and the tip of his nose were also covered with a layer of fine beads of sweat. The whole room was steaming, with a strong scent of medicine.",
        "Shen Kong stood up and stretched his muscles and bones. Then he walked to the bathroom to wash off the remaining medicated oil on his hands.",
        "Han Li, who was left alone in the living room, rolled down his trouser legs and carefully moved his knees. He felt that the stiff and swollen wounds on his knees were no longer too painful. Even the pain in his heart and lungs that had tormented him for many years in rainy seasons was no longer there. The cold and severe pain in his eyes had obviously slowed down a lot. He couldn’t help but look up in surprise at the bathroom, where the sound of rushing water came from. There was a complicated look in his pitch-dark eyes: ",
        "“You, what kind of medicine did you use?”",
        "Shen Kong turned off the faucet and walked out of the bathroom. He replied casually:",
        "“It’s just ordinary medicated oil. You can buy it from the drugstore at the entrance for 20 yuan.”",
        "He wasn’t lying about this. Cheng Chen’s family was not well off, and the medicines he kept at home for injuries were all very cheap, usually sold to common people. ",
        "Shen Kong had gone through challenging experiences and had barely escaped with his life for so many years that he could be regarded as a doctor. He was not only an expert in breaking other people’s bones but also had extraordinary experience in treating his own wounds.",
        "He took out an extra quilt from the closet and threw it on the sofa, not bothering to modestly give up his place in the master bedroom:",
        "“You sleep here.”",
        "After saying that, Shen Kong yawned and ignored Han Li, falling backward on the bed. ",
        "He took out his mobile phone from his pocket, but no matter how many times he pressed the screen button, the screen was completely black. There was no response at all. When he shook it vigorously, water droplets dripped from the gap on the side of the mobile phone——its machine was originally so cheap that it completely died after being soaked in rain.",
        "Shen Kong foolishly tinkered with it for a while and then threw the completely damaged mobile phone aside. He narrowed his eyes lazily, starting to miss the millions he had pried away from the kidnappers last time.",
        "Although a part of it was paid to the doctor, there were still more than 4 million US dollars left in the follow-up period. He didn’t know if the money he earned last time could be withdrawn at this time…",
        "Thinking of this, he couldn’t help but regret a little——he should have gotten the eight million from the Zhao family before leaving. ",
        "In his previous world, Shen Kong’s attitude towards money was very arbitrary.",
        "After all, what he worked as was inherently precarious. After working today, he might not see tomorrow.",
        "",
        "He was used to earning enough money at once that an average person could spend a lifetime, and then spending it all in one night. He was always very knowledgeable about spending money. Shen Kong was the one who could always find the weirdest ways to spend money. After that, he would turn around and leave without hesitation when his pockets were empty——so his consumption attitude was very optimistic: Life is a playground. Do whatever you want, and you can leave at any time.",
        "Shen Kong rested his arm on his pillow and gazed at the small, dark water stain seeping out from the edge of the dirty ceiling, thinking in a trance: ",
        "​Perhaps… with this temporary identity, he could go out and occasionally earn a little money?",
        "The window was slapped by the evening wind carrying raindrops, making a faint crashing sound in the silent and dark night, which seemed particularly clear and abrupt in the quiet room.",
        "Han Li had already readied the bedding. He laid down on the sofa, slightly closed his eyes, and stared thoughtfully at Shen Kong lying not far away.",
        "He remembered this student—— ",
        "Cheng Chen had just transferred to this school for half a year. He studied well, but he was very withdrawn and seemed to be deliberately excluded and isolated.",
        "Although Han Li rarely came to school, he basically knew most of what happened in the class like the palm of his hand, especially when there were transfer students in the class——after all, he had to always be on guard against the Han family in the capital from noticing his secret movements here. Han Li had already experienced the dirty methods used by the Han family eight years ago, and his unpreparedness and blind trust cost him his legs.",
        "But facing this person in front of him, Han Li realized that he couldn’t understand him at all.",
        "He seemed to be indifferent to everything around him, but underneath this appearance, there seemed to be a stubborn and extreme sense of justice buried deep inside. ",
        "The strangest thing was that he seemed to have no understanding of himself at all.",
        "​​And… perhaps because of the circumstances in which the two met, the other party seemed to treat him as some kind of weak person to protect…?",
        "One must know that no one who had come into contact with Han Li dared to look at him and treat him as a weak person. He did not often show up on campus, and those students who knew nothing about him always instinctively treated him with three points of reverence and cautiousness.",
        "And the other party’s slightness and vague protectiveness… were very strange. ",
        "But for some reason, Han Li didn’t hate it."
