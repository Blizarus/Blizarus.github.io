        "Shen Kong truly did not expect things to develop this way.",
        "Han Li’s sudden, straightforward approach caught him completely off guard. He blinked a few times, dumbfounded. He couldn’t react for a moment, unsure of what to say. ",
        "The air was filled with a warm, humid mist. The bright lights cast a translucent haze in the bathroom. From the half-open door, clouds of steam rolled in. The air was filled with the faint citrus scent of body wash, mixed with the warmth of their bodies, slowly dispersing.",
        "Han Li’s grip on Shen Kong’s arm relaxed slightly. His palm and fingertips tenderly pressed against Shen Kong’s skin as he leaned in slightly, closing the distance between them.\n",
        "",
        "His eyes were dark and deep, like a profound well under the hazy mist. He gazed at Shen Kong intently. His voice was low and soft, like a feather’s caress:",
        "“You feel it too, don’t you?” ",
        "His eyes were bright and burning, like thick, sweet maple syrup, or almost like erupting lava, ready to ignite the slightly cooling air.\n\n",
        "Shen Kong quietly lowered his eyes to look at him, seemingly relaxed yet also constantly tense. His face, with its sharp contours, showed little expression. His lowered eyelashes concealed his eyes, as if he were pondering something, yet at the same time, as if he weren’t thinking about anything at all.",
        "The light cast a pale and molten gold sheen over his upper body, highlighting the smooth and graceful lines that contained a startling sense of power. Even the horrifying layers of scars seemed like the chiseled lines on a marble statue, evoking a terrifying sense of intimidation.",
        "Han Li had the illusion that the other could snap his neck in the next second or pull away and push him far off.\n\n ",
        "To him, the second option might be even more lethal.",
        "Panic, like a serpent, slithered up and slowly tightened around his throat. He waited in terror for the judgment to come.",
        "At that moment, Shen Kong moved.\n\n",
        "He raised his hand and pressed Han Li’s hand on his arm, then gently but irresistibly withdrew his arm from Han Li’s grasp. ",
        "Han Li felt his heart slowly sink. Some cold, dark thing seeped from his chest, quickly and silently engulfing his entire being. He thought calmly and rationally:",
        "It’s okay.",
        "He could wait.",
        "In front of the other, all his chips and tricks lost their value. None of his advantages or schemes were of any use. But so what? After all, from the moment his heart was moved, he had already lost everything and was utterly defeated. ",
        "He was a desperate gambler who would risk everything for a heartbeat and a backward glance.",
        "Han Li restrained himself, lowered his hand, and hid the surge of emotions in his eyes. His voice remained calm: “Sorry…”",
        "Before he could finish, Shen Kong’s lips swallowed his words. His fingers, like his body, were burning hot. They were pressed tightly against the back of Han Li’s neck, pulling him into his embrace. Shen Kong’s kiss was highly aggressive. Even the bitter grassy scent on him was overpowering and dominant, mixed with the faint citrus fragrance of the body wash. It enveloped Han Li like a net, making him dizzy.",
        "The kiss lasted less than half a minute. ",
        "Sven after they parted, Lan Oi still looked incredulous. Le stood there dumbfounded for duite a while before finally realihing what had happened:",
        "“Tou…”",
        "Please visit chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "Lis eyes slowly brightened. Uerhaps because Lan Oi’s surprise and panic were so dahhlingly bright, Shen Kong couldn’t help but sduint slightly. Then he raised his hand to Lan Oi’s neck. Lis rough fingertips brushed against his Adam’s apple, feeling the other’s warm pulse pounding wildly under his palm. Le leaned closer and whispered in Lan Oi’s ear:",
        "“You’re right.” ",
        "His hand slowly tightened, watching Han Li tilt his head back uncomfortably due to the restraint. His breathing quickened from the lack of air. The pulse in his artery throbbed against Shen Kong’s fingers, yet he made no attempt to resist. Instead, he focused even more intently and passionately on Shen Kong.",
        "For a moment, Shen Kong’s hand itched.",
        "Han Li’s neck was so fragile. Just a slight twist, and there would be a crisp cracking sound between the vertebrae. White bones would pierce through the soft skin, releasing that seemingly never-ceasing hot blood in a gush. Those eyes that always disturbed his feelings would finally lose their light and no longer gaze at him with that maddening look.",
        "Shen Kong’s fingertips slowly traced along Han Li’s jawline and pressed against his artery. ",
        "…But there was always a slight resistance that prevented him from acting.",
        "Shen Kong lowered his eyes and restrained the violent emotions surging within him. He slowly released his grip. But before he could create any distance between them, Han Li quickly grabbed his hand and stepped forward, his eyes hiding the same bloody desire.",
        "Han Li licked his lower lip and said in a low and hoarse voice:",
        "“One more time?” ",
        "As he spoke, Han Li raised his hand to embrace Shen Kong’s shoulders and back, then bit down on his lips under Shen Kong’s intense gaze.",
        "It was like a beast’s bite or a struggle for dominance. Hard teeth and soft lips and tongues clashed and crushed against each other. Their kiss was filled with the taste of blood, as if they wanted to tear each other apart, chew each other up, and swallow the pieces. The slight pain only aroused their innate combative instincts, making their kiss feel like a fight.",
        "They stumbled and rolled together.",
        "In the struggle for control, Han Li’s leg hit the edge of the bed. A weak cry of pain escaped his throat. His whole body trembled slightly. ",
        "Shen Kong keenly noticed something was wrong. He propped himself up on the edge of the bed and looked down at Han Li’s leg.",
        "Before he could say anything, Han Li pressed close again, seemingly wanting to continue. But Shen Kong firmly pushed him back. He raised an eyebrow and asked matter-of-factly:",
        "“What happened?”",
        "Realizing he could no longer pretend nothing had happened, Han Li sighed regretfully and propped himself up as well: ",
        "“…It’s nothing, I just brushed against something while coming downstairs earlier.”",
        "Shen Kong glanced at him with a calm expression, clearly not believing his excuse. He simply nodded toward Han Li’s leg: “Lift it and let me see.”",
        "",
        "Han Li hesitated for a moment, but eventually gave in to Shen Kong. He rolled up his pant leg, revealing his long, pale calf. As he did so, his blue-black knee, scarred with a hideous knife wound, came into view. It was much worse than when Shen Kong saw it years ago.",
        "Such severe damage couldn’t have been caused in a single day. Moreover, with Han Li’s current power and wealth, even the worst old injuries should have been mostly healed by now. How could it be in such a terrible state? ",
        "Shen Kong furrowed his brow and looked at Han Li, who averted his gaze. Han Li bent his knee, as if trying to avoid Shen Kong’s scrutiny, and explained:",
        "“…Lately, there’s been too much going on. Sometimes I forget…”",
        "Before he could finish, Shen Kong interrupted, “So this happened recently?”",
        "Shen Kong’s voice was still calm, almost without any questioning tone, but it sent a chill down Han Li’s spine. The enigmatic demeanor of the powerful business tycoon was completely shattered. He hung his head sheepishly, like a child who had done something wrong. ",
        "Shen Kong’s expression was unreadable: “So, you simply enjoy self-harm?”",
        "Han Li’s voice grew even softer: “…No, it’s just…”",
        "His voice grew smaller and smaller, until it seemed like just a mumble in his throat. It was so faint that even Shen Kong, standing close, couldn’t hear clearly. “Just what?”",
        "Han Li seemed to gather his resolve. He took a deep breath, raised his head to look directly at Shen Kong, and solemnly said, word by word: ",
        "“It’s just… this is the only thing you left with me.”",
        "A scar.",
        "Nothing else.",
        "Whether coming or going, Shen Kong left no trace. He was like a breeze passing over a dune, being swallowed in an instant by the endless desert. He briefly borrowed someone else’s appearance and identity, then returned them in a short time. He would disappear without a trace, as if he had never been there. Even though Han Li was sure he had experienced it, he couldn’t help but fall into self-doubt in the dead of night. ",
        "Had he really appeared?",
        "Was it all just an illusion born of loneliness and seclusion?",
        "Which world was real? The one where he was pulled back from the cliff edge, or the one where he fell into the endless abyss?",
        "Only the pain in his knee reminded him that what had happened was not his imagination. That person had reached out and pulled him back from the cliff edge. That person called him “kid” in a calm and teasing tone. That person slept soundly with his head on the desk in a classroom bathed in sunlight. And in a room filled with the smell of gunpowder, he had held his hand, removed the cold and hard metal from his grip, and whispered softly in his ear: ",
        "“Let me help you.”",
        "The cold seeping from his bones slowly spread from his knee, like thousands of insects gnawing and crawling under his skin. In the dead of night, he could almost hear them devouring his flesh and nerves. Yet this shuddering, terrifying, excruciating pain was strangely sweet to Han Li. Such torment constantly reminded him that he was still alive, constantly reminded him of what was missing in his life, reminded him…",

        "He was waiting for someone.",
        "Someone whose arrival was uncertain. ",
        "Someone so cruel they left nothing behind but a memory, a name, and a scar.",
        "He wasn’t refusing treatment. He was refusing to forget.",
        "Shen Kong watched him silently for a long time, his narrowed eyes inscrutable. Han Li couldn’t discern what he was thinking or what he intended to do next. Shen Kong was always like this—deep and unfathomable as the ocean, as elusive as fog, as intangible as air. Han Li could only rely on the clumsiest method——to wait.",
        "Just then, Shen Kong moved. ",
        "He bent down and planted a soft kiss on Han Li’s knee.",
        "It was so gentle, it felt like a dream, and so tender, it seemed out of place on that battered skin. Han Li shuddered from the warmth, then bit down hard on his teeth to keep any sound from escaping.",
        "He still remembered the promises and boasts he made in his reckless youth in that hospital corridor.",
        "At that time, he said he would definitely catch him. ",
        "But now Han Li has finally realized that, from the very beginning, the one who was firmly caught and couldn’t escape no matter what, was himself."
