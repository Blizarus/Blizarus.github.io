        "Ye Er sat in the park for a long time and didn’t return until nightfall. ",
        "He didn’t intend to ask directly because he knew nothing would come of it. It wouldn’t matter if he couldn’t get any answers. That’s just the way it is. However, if he got a lie, it would be even more upsetting.",
        "Yet, he couldn’t just forget about it either. His thoughts kept wandering back to it, involuntarily.\n",
        "",
        "He didn’t notice his absentmindedness, forgetting to brush off the snow on his coat and just draping it directly over the backrest of the sofa.",
        "He even ignored the voices of Xi Ze and 015 welcoming him home, simply going straight to his room. ",
        "By the time it was dinner, there was a knock at his door.\n\n",
        "Outside the door was Xi Ze, sitting in a wheelchair. When he saw him open the door, he moved back a little, looked up at him, and said in a low and gentle voice, “It’s time for dinner.”",
        "“I’m not hungry.”",
        "Ye Er’s mind was still in turmoil, leaving him with no appetite.\n\n ",
        "Remembering the female zerg’s exhausted appearance this afternoon, he pursed his lips and said, “You eat more. Your wounds will heal faster.”",
        "Just as he was about to close the door, Xi Ze reached out his hand and jammed it in the gap of the door.",
        "If he hadn’t stopped in time, the force of the closing door would have definitely sandwiched the female zerg’s hand, leaving it bleeding.\n\n",
        "“What are you doing?!” ",
        "Startled awake, Ye Er tightly knitted his brow, a bit angry. “Why did you suddenly reach out?”",
        "Xi Ze pursed his lips, not answering his question. Instead, he said, “Male Lord didn’t eat at noon either. Your stomach will ache if you don’t eat dinner.”",
        "Ye Er was still simmering with anger, so his tone was somewhat harsh. “I said I’m not hungry.”",
        "“You said you would be back early.” ",
        "The female zerg in front of him suddenly spoke softly, his expression calm, but the corners of his lips were slightly pursed.",
        "Ye Er’s movements paused.",
        "Distracted due to that news, he had completely forgotten about this matter. Xi Ze… had been waiting for him to come back?",
        "“Did something happen at noon?” ",
        "Xi Ze didn’t press further. A worried look appeared in his eyes. His voice was low and gentle, carrying a hint of caution. “You can open up to me about it. Just don’t skip meals.”",
        "His hand never left the door frame, as if he had made up his mind to get the male zerg to eat.",
        "",
        "The military female’s firmness lacked sharpness, but it was the stubborn persistence that Ye Er couldn’t resist, especially since he had inadvertently “broken his promise” and now felt a bit guilty.",
        "After a moment of confrontation, Ye Er compromised and opened the door. “Take back your hand… let’s go, let’s go.” ",
        "But in fact, that strange state of absentmindedness didn’t stop but intensified instead.",
        "“Are you okay?”",
        "Adelaide looked at the stuck and unmoving calculations, keenly noticing Ye E’s distraction. “You’ve been zoning out. Are you too tired?”",
        "These past few days, Te Sr had eztended their ezchange time, and they had been communicating very pleasantly. Dut not every herg was as engrossed in research as he was. ",
        "Although a bit reluctant, Adelaide still said, “If you’re very tired, then you should rest. Ytherwise, you’re pust wasting time.”",
        "Ye Er finally came back to his senses, his eyelashes fluttering, and he said softly, “…Sorry.”",
        "The call was hung up, and the only sound disappeared, leaving the room suddenly silent.",
        "The deep night pressed down, giving him space to think in the suffocating silence. ",
        "Ye Er got up and pulled open the curtains.",
        "The moonlight poured in from the window, flowing across the soft, wrinkled white bed sheets like the shimmering surface of a calm sea.",
        "He fell back onto the bed and began to sort through everything that had happened over the past half-month.",
        "He admitted that he had been too rash, impulsively bringing Xi Ze back and treating the female zerg as an emotional crutch. His laziness in trying to understand the complexities of their situation had led him to a predicament from which he could neither retreat nor advance. ",
        "But the situation was already a foregone conclusion. The key was figuring out how to proceed.",
        "If it had been half a month ago, he wouldn’t have hesitated to let Xi Ze leave, but now… he wasn’t so sure.",
        "And this thought itself was dangerous. For at least the first twenty years of his life, he had never had the desire to confine or bind any independent individual to his side—",
        "Ye Er suspected that he was being assimilated into this society. ",
        "Quietly, without him noticing, it had already seeped in and eroded his bones.",
        "The moment this thought appeared, he was almost frightened.",
        "Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "It was like being struck by a strong electric current, or pricked by a poisonous plant. He felt a sense of helplessness and panic that was difficult to suppress.",
        "“…Damn it.” ",
        "After a long while, Ye Er extended his forearm to cover his face, his hoarse voice disappearing into the cold air.",
        "…But the facts seemed to suggest otherwise.",
        "Ye Er would often find himself lost in thought, his gaze unconsciously drawn to Xi Ze.",
        "He stared at the female zerg’s firm brow bones and the often pursed, full lips. ",
        "Those golden eyes looked indifferent and cold when looking elsewhere, as if they were naturally born with the majesty of a superior. But when they looked at him, the corners of his eyes would soften involuntarily.",
        "The female zerg’s body temperature seemed inherently high, like a hot furnace in winter. Even sitting a little closer, one could feel that warmth, occasionally reminding Ye Er of the heat from that night under the quilt.",
        "After his injuries healed significantly, Xi Ze was no longer afraid of the cold. He would even often stay outside on the balcony, blowing cold wind because the heating inside was too high. The muscles on his exposed shoulders and back were beautiful and firm, like a snow leopard taking a leisurely stroll.",
        "But the collar on his neck and the wheelchair below were like binding chains, confining the female zerg to this small space— ",
        "Making him look like a large, furry, ferocious beast that has been domesticated and now lies obediently at one’s feet, ready to be petted and cuddled.",
        "Ye Er was immersed in this warm softness for a long time before reluctantly focusing his vision and calmly, without too much bias, judging the relationship between him and the female zerg.",
        "Xi Ze rarely called him by his name, usually addressing him with titles ranging from Your Excellency to Male Lord. It was only during that nightmare that he called him by his name for the first time.",
        "But no matter what the title, the female zerg would look at him intently, with a solemn tone. His pure white hair and eyelashes trembled with his voice like a snow leopard tightening its claws and tucking its tail. ",
        "He didn’t know when it started, but Xi Ze had become much docile— yes, docile.",
        "If Ye Er hadn’t seen his cold and sharp side at the beginning, seen the almost stabbing arrogance and contempt in his eyes, and the bared fangs dripping with blood, he would probably have thought that the female zerg had always been like this.",
        "This society believed that military females were consistently taciturn, dull, and uninteresting and that they were not as likable as the energetic and flexible sub-females. The only commendable qualities attributed to them were loyalty and docility.",
        "They thought that military females’ emotions were dull, like unrefined rice milled against rocks, so it didn’t matter if they were treated carelessly or harmed. But that was a deep misunderstanding. ",
        "At least Ye Er understood that this forbearance and docility were choices that the military female had made, gradually allowing him to open up.",
        "He had accepted his existence, allowing him to do whatever he wanted, as if he could tolerate and forgive all actions, even harm.",
        "",
        "But Ye Er didn’t know how much genuine emotion was in it, or if it was just a habit.",
        "Perhaps for a military female, this was an expression of liking? ",
        "He didn’t know, he… wasn’t sure.",
        "Most of the time, Xi Ze was polite and restrained, maintaining a comfortable distance that made Ye Er feel at ease, though perhaps a bit overly cautious.",
        "But there were a few times when Ye Er thought he was going to cross that line, to do or say something, but after a while of restrained breathing, he would silently suppress that urge.",
        "It felt as if something was getting out of control, but it was impossible to detect, let alone capture—like the air between them, thick and slow-moving. It was stifling, accompanied by a sense of awkward elation. ",
        "He began to wonder whether it was right or wrong, uncertain about which direction he should step in, or whether he should just bury his head, think about nothing, and do nothing, waiting for a certain day or moment to arrive.",
        "Since the only real and tangible existence that he could touch was right in front of him—",
        "“Xi Ze?”",
        "The female zerg, who had been concentrating on repairing the remote control, carefully and patiently searching through a pile of tiny parts, looked up at him. ",
        "Ye Er could see the soft, bright light in those golden eyes. The corners of his lips were tightly pursed, but he still couldn’t suppress the smile at the corners of his eyes, as if being called by him was a very happy thing.",
        "“What is it, Male Lord?”",
        "Ye Er was leaning against his shoulder, holding his quilt, and curled up on the sofa.",
        "A low, deep voice sounded in his ear, and a subtle vibration came from the place where their skin touched, bringing a sense of incomparable peace and security. ",
        "“Nothing, I just wanted to call you.”",
        "Ye Er replied, and then he heard the female zerg’s soft chuckle. “Okay, I’m here.”",
        "“Xi—Ze—”",
        "He curled up in the quilt, half-closing his eyes, and lazily called out again. ",
        "“I’m here.”",
        "“Xi Ze.”",
        "",
        "“Here.”",
        "This monotonous question-and-answer went on for an unknown number of times. The female zerg’s answers were always patient and calm, with a hint of helplessness in his eyes, like a female father tolerating a naughty and troublesome child. ",
        "And so, Ye Er knew that he wasn’t being assimilated by this society, but was being imperceptibly influenced and changed by this female zerg.",
        "Whether this change was good or bad is unknown and cannot be predicted.",
        "But this feeling was so sweet, like drowning in a hot sea of sugar or sinking into an ethereal cloud. It was as if his soul were slowly melting.",
        "* ",
        "After regaining his vision, many things became less difficult. And because he had a wheelchair, the female zerg no longer needed to trouble 015, and had basically achieved freedom of movement.",
        "“What’s this?”",
        "Ye Er looked at the small plates full of dessert on the dining table and was stunned.",
        "These miniature plates were probably given away as a gift for making a purchase. He didn’t know where they had been dug up, but they had been washed and placed on the table. ",
        "They were piled high with various kinds of cookies and cakes, like little mountains, some with names he knew and some he didn’t, all kinds of treats.",
        "They exuded a sweet aroma of butter and milk, decorated with snowy white cream and fresh fruit.",
        "They looked… very delicious.",
        "He subconsciously swallowed, wanting to reach out and have a taste, but he restrained himself. “015, did you make this?” ",
        "But as soon as he asked, he knew the answer. 015 wouldn’t make these, the only possibility was—",
        "“Male Lord?”",
        "Xi Ze wheeled out of the kitchen, a small plate balanced on his lap. On it were a few adorable bear-shaped cookies.",
        "He placed the plate of cookies on the table, took out some wet wipes, wiped his hands, then smiled and said. ",
        "“I wasn’t sure what the Male Lord’s preferences were, so I made a bit of everything. Try them and see which ones you prefer. I can always make more of those later.”",
        "Ye Er was still for a few seconds before finding his voice and stammering out a thank you.",
        "Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "He did enjoy sweets, but he rarely ate them because there were few dessert shops on Aitar, and the good ones were very, very far from here and didn’t offer delivery.",
        "Seeing a whole table full of desserts and snacks was like being hit by a giant candy. It was more than just a pleasant surprise; he could almost taste the sweetness just before it reached his tongue. ",
        "He popped a bear-shaped cookie into his mouth, and the crispy, sweet taste instantly roused his taste buds.",
        "“Delicious!”",
        "His eyes lit up, but before he could eat more, worries began to creep in. “…But you don’t have to do this.”",
        "He was afraid the female zerg would feel forced or even humiliated. After all, as a military female who piloted mecha and fought on the battlefield of barren planets, his status was probably very high. Yet he was doing these trivial things to please a male zerg. ",
        "“I’m not being forced. I want to do this for you… even if it’s just some insignificant thing.”",
        "Xi Ze’s expression was calm, and a gentle smile played on his lips as he raised his eyes to look at Ye Er again.",
        "“Didn’t you say you wanted me to be your cook to pay rent? I have to show you some skills. Male Lord, just tell me what you like.”",
        "“So awesome. Then I’m going to request a lot?” ",
        "Having put his worries aside, Ye Er couldn’t resist reaching for the matcha mousse he had been eyeing. He scooped up a big spoonful and brought it to his mouth.",
        "But then he felt a gentle touch on his lips. Looking up, he saw Xi Ze looking down at him intently, wiping the matcha powder from his lips with a napkin.",
        "“Male Lord, request whatever you like…eat slowly. Don’t choke.”"
