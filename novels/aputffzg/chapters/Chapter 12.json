        "Raising a female zerg hasn’t brought much change to life. ",
        "Apart from some expectations of going home, it’s still all about firewood, rice, oil, and salt; a daily routine in life of going to work and leaving work.",
        "But lately, the living room and bathroom at home have been unusually clean.\n",
        "Please visit chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "015 cleans every day, but it’s just a basic sweeping of trash and tidying up things, far from achieving spotless cleanliness. The bathroom is also regularly kept dry and tidy, with no stagnant water or stray hair strands.",
        "Recently, the little robot housekeeper also seems to have had much fewer malfunctions. The once common occurrences of short circuits and sparks have now become rare, and it has even learned how to cut carrot flowers. ",
        "In response to this change, 015 just dim-wittedly said it might be the new chip at work.\n\n",
        "It wasn’t until one dinner, when the food 015 served was completely free of the faint burned taste it used to have, that this normalcy seemed strange.",
        "Ye Er held onto that round and chubby head with a grave expression.",
        "“Come clean. Did you secretly update your system? The maintenance technician mentioned before that with your small memory capacity, updating could potentially cause a complete system crash.”\n\n ",
        "015 blinked its electronic eyes and replied rather slowly, “No.”",
        "Ye Er suspiciously opened its head to inspect but found no melted or broken components inside. Only then did he reluctantly believe, “…But why wasn’t tonight’s dinner burned?”",
        "As they talked, Xi Ze sat on the chair next to them, slowly stirring the nutritional meal in his bowl with a spoon, eating quietly and quickly.\n\n",
        "“Did you repair it?” Ye Er suddenly turned his head. ",
        "Xi Ze was caught off guard. His hand paused in motion, hesitated for a few seconds, and then admitted, “Yes.”",
        "“Are your eyes feeling better?” This was the only possibility Ye Er could think of.",
        "Hughes said that the female zerg’s right eye was close to blindness, and the left eye was infected as well. There’s a possibility of recovery with ongoing medication.",
        "This time, Xi Ze neither nodded nor shook his head. He just tightened his grip on the spoon in his hand. ",
        "Seeing that he didn’t want to talk about it, Ye Er changed the subject. “Did you also clean the living room and bathroom?”",
        "“What cleaning? I didn’t see it!”",
        "015 was shocked and fluttered out of Ye Er’s hand. “You’re still recovering, you shouldn’t engage in strenuous activities!”",
        "This time, the female zerg hesitated for a longer time, but eventually nodded. This was because Ye Er had “ordered” before that there should be no intentional lying or hiding, and Ye Er’s inquiry had almost confirmed the answer. ",
        "Even if there are no growing conditions for a river snail, one must create conditions for it as a river snail.",
        "Ye Er almost laughed out of exasperation.",
        "",
        "But looking at Xi Ze’s tight-lipped and withdrawn look, it was evident that he would not comply obediently.",
        "“I want to find something to do. I can’t just…” ",
        "The female zerg rarely spoke up on his own initiative, his voice sounding strained and hesitant as he tried to make Ye Er understand his thoughts. “Do nothing all day, like a shameless parasite.”",
        "It was natural for his strong sense of pride as a military female to prevent him from just lying down, eating the male zerg’s food, using the male zerg’s clothes, and staying in the male zerg’s house to recover without doing anything in return.",
        "Swords may wear down and break, but to be buried in the land of tenderness and lose their sharpness is considered a disgrace. This is a principle and pride engraved in their bones.",
        "Te Sr was struck speechless. Le had indeed not thought about this problem before. ",
        "Uerhaps the female herg was too bored, so he should be given something to do, but being blind is indeed a significant obstacle.",
        "He pondered to himself for a moment, then got up and went to the balcony.",
        "After a while, Ye Er returned from outside. The chill on his sweater was yet to dissipate. He sat back down in his seat and began to unpack the thing in his hands layer by layer.",
        "He didn’t notice the female zerg in front of him looking a bit flustered, his hand on the table clenched into a fist. ",
        "“I’m sorry, I won’t do it again…”",
        "“What?” the ignorant and unaware Ye Er asked, stuffing the item into the female zerg’s hands. “This is for you.”",
        "The female zerg suddenly stopped talking, looking a bit dazed, then he gingerly touched the object in his hands, as if it were a dangerous item.",
        "“This was given to me as a gift when I bought something a few days ago. The supermarket owner said it’s easy to take care of and can survive even in winter, but I almost killed it in just a few days.” ",
        "Ye Er looked at the small pot of plants with some guilt. The once beautiful green leaves and red vines were now mostly withered and yellow, with leaves drooping and coiled into pointed tips, indeed close to death.",
        "“Can you help me loosen the soil and water it every day? Maybe it can still survive.”",
        "Xi Ze paused slightly and raised his eyes to look at Ye Er. His vision was blurry, and he could only vaguely see a fuzzy shadow.",
        "The male zerg forgot to move his fingers from the back of his hands. His fingers were cold and smooth to the touch, just like the small clay pot in his palm, with a distinct sense of presence. ",
        "He quietly tightened his fingers and replied softly, “…Okay.”",
        "As if afraid of disturbing a butterfly that landed on his eyelashes.",
        "Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "The small plant was named Red Jade Vine. As it matures, its vines turn a vibrant red, resembling glossy jade, and demand precise monitoring of watering frequency and quantity. It is easy for beginners to inadvertently kill it.",
        "Xi Ze seemed to have experience in flower care. Even though he was blind, he also clumsily got the hang of it. ",
        "Ye Er occasionally walked through the living room and could always see Xi Ze solemnly loosening the soil for the Red Jade Vine. His slightly furrowed brow didn’t look like he was gardening; it was more like he was calculating on a sand table or correcting some confidential documents.",
        "After a few days of care, Ye Er approached to observe for a moment and then let out a long hum. “It doesn’t seem to have changed much.”",
        "In fact, the small plant improved quite a bit, going from a wilted cluster to showing some signs of perking up.",
        "Xi Ze lowered his gaze, avoiding his eyes, and after a while, he said softly, “There has been some change. The stem has grown half an inch taller, an extra leaf has grown, and the texture of the vine feels a bit smoother…” ",
        "The speaker seemed to have completely forgotten the passive resistance of silence. The female zerg explained its changes with the same concentration and seriousness as if they were carefully detailing the performance and structure of a mecha.",
        "Ye Er rested his chin in his hand and smiled silently at those words.",
        "He reached out to touch the newly grown tender leaf, laughing from the nose. “I hope you’re able to tell good from bad. Grow up quickly.”",
        "Xi Ze was taken aback by the first part of the sentence and the subsequent pause. It wasn’t until he heard the rest of the sentence that he realized the male zerg was speaking to the Red Jade Vine. ",
        "Obviously, the tone was reproachful, but it carried a light and affectionate smile, with a slight upward inflection at the end, like a kitten extending its paws to tenderly scratch the heart, evoking a burst of tickling sensation.",
        "After “threatening” the little Red Jade Vine, he squinted his eyes and said in a softer voice, “You also need to get better soon.”",
        "Xi Ze’s hand on the coffee table suddenly trembled, and then his fingers tightened.",
        "He didn’t realize his ears had turned red. The cold and serious expression was replaced by a hint of fluster. After a long hesitation, he opened his mouth, and said, “…Mn…okay…” ",
        "“Forget it. These things don’t get done just by thinking about them. I’ll be diligent in changing your dressing. I’ll try to make you feel better before the New Year, or else you’ll have to eat tasteless nutritional meals.”",
        "Ye Er let out a tired yawn, got up, ruffled Xi Ze’s hair as usual, and then left calmly.",
        "Recently, the weather in Aitar has been very good, with several consecutive sunny days. The long-lost sunlight pierced through the somber clouds, illuminating the endless snow with a dazzling brilliance.",
        "The small red leaf vine basked in the sun for a few days, gradually stretching out its branches and leaves. ",
        "The wounds on Xi Ze’s body also showed signs of healing, most notably the wide laceration on his back.",
        "The female zerg’s bone wings were connected to countless blood vessels and nerves. When they were pulled out, it was like uprooting a tree from the soil, causing the flesh to tear apart, the pain unbearable and difficult to describe in words.",
        "",
        "After about a week of care, the wound transitioned from severe mutilation to inflammation and swelling, with the discharge changing from foul blood to tissue fluid seepage.",
        "But no matter what stage it was, shortly after changing the dressing, the gauze would stick to the wound and tear off forcefully during the next change, akin to torture. ",
        "Each time Ye Er changed the dressing, he would be drenched in sweat, and the female zerg lying on the waterproof cloth would be even more taut throughout his body.",
        "The expanse of light honey was adorned with tiny water droplets, resembling a pot of melting maple syrup, though less hot and thick. The outer edge of the upturned flesh was tinged with white, trembling ever so slightly, as if extremely cold.",
        "Handing over the aftermath to 015 to clean up, Ye Er stood up and stretched his sore muscles. Xi Ze took a moment to relax before reluctantly sitting up and grabbing the coat beside him to drape over himself.",
        "“Thank you.” ",
        "A slightly hoarse voice came and Ye Er turned to look at him. “It looks like the wound is healing. Maybe it will scab over soon.”",
        "Xi Ze hummed, but his expression was somewhat at a loss, unsure of how to respond.",
        "The wound was healing slowly, but they still didn’t know what was going on between him and Ye Er.",
        "After all, neither of them was overly simplistic as to overlook numerous obstacles and be open about their personalities. They were just barely getting along in a relatively peaceful manner. ",
        "Or perhaps this is part of the male zerg’s game process, a gentle yet cruel game of house, where both the Red Jade Vine and changing of dressing are merely props and daily routine tasks within the male zerg’s game.",
        "Similar to watering, fertilizing, and waiting for the tree to mature, and then picking the juiciest and most plump fruit from it.",
        "He didn’t know when that time truly came. What awaited him would be new growth or complete destruction.",
        "The heating in the living room was on full blast, but it still felt cold without clothes. Xi Ze sat on the sofa lost in thought, not noticing that his hair was damp with cold sweat, and his lips were unnaturally pale. ",
        "Then a towel was placed over his head, and Ye Er’s voice sounded.",
        "“Wipe off the sweat, don’t catch a cold. I’ll ask 015 to feed you some hot milk later. Go to bed early tonight.”",
        "Xi Ze’s eyelashes trembled slightly, and he suddenly decided not to think about it anymore.",
        "The itch during the growth of flesh and blood is more unbearable than intense pain, as if tender shoots were drilling into the crevices of the bones, weaving through the blood vessels, making it difficult to endure even breathing during the onset. ",
        "In order to avoid inadvertently scratching the newly formed scab in his sleep, Xi Ze stayed up all night with his eyes shut. The suppressed and restrained breath seeped through the crack of the door from the quiet living room into the room.",
        "The room was dim, with Ye Er lying on the bed, staring blankly at the ceiling. He then fell asleep to the gradually softening sound of Xi Ze’s breathing.",
        "Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "One day after work, Ye Er carried home a dog-shaped bolster pillow.",
        "Amidst 015’s excited cries, he extended the fluffy tail in front of the female zerg. “Want to touch it?” ",
        "“What is it…”",
        "Xi Ze appeared somewhat hesitant, his fingertips pausing on the delicate fur. He tilted his head slightly and asked softly, “Is it alive?”",
        "Ye Er gave off a “pfft” sound, then smiled and tucked the long dog into his arms. “I’ll give you this to hold. It’s not good for your legs to curl up. Holding this will be more comfortable.”",
        "The injury on Xi Ze’s back made it difficult for him to lie flat, but sleeping on his side would make him unconsciously curl up, which was not good for his legs and the front injury, causing his posture to be somewhat twisted. It was almost visibly uncomfortable. ",
        "This was what Ye Er discovered one morning when he suddenly woke up and walked into the living room to drink water.",
        "Xi Ze subconsciously touched the stuffed animal, and in contrast to his fingers, which were filled with stiff and hard calluses, the fabric and fur felt exceptionally delicate, with the cotton-filled interior as soft as a cloud.",
        "“…Thank you.”",
        "He seemed a little at a loss, facing the thing in his arms, and the gentle tone of the male zerg in front of him. ",
        "He was once confident that he would not be deceived by lies and masks, no matter how cleverly disguised they were with sweet words and acts. Nature could never be concealed; a single glance in the eye and a breath would inevitably expose some flaws.",
        "Putting on an act in a brief encounter is challenging enough, let alone maintaining a long-term and intimate interaction.",
        "Malice cannot be hidden, neither can tenderness and goodwill.",
        "Countless arrows dipped in honey are striking his defenses, unrestrained, soft, and light, akin to a stone soaked in a honey pot for a long time. Even his previously indestructible shell was slowly being eroded. ",
        "“I’ll see when it’s convenient. I’ll take you to the hospital for a follow-up appointment, and…”",
        "Ye Er did not notice his complicated emotions and began to calculate when he could have a second round of reexamination.",
        "“I will soon be on New Year’s holidays, with about half a month of free time. Speaking of which, I need to prepare some things for the New Year.”",
        "“It seems like there isn’t much rice and noodles left at home, and we can also buy some flour…” ",
        "015, as always, responded energetically, “We can try making some desserts. I recently downloaded a new recipe!”",
        "Ye Er’s fingers tapped the iron head of 015 and couldn’t help but chuckle. “Hmm… Just make sure you don’t blow up the kitchen.”",
        "",
        "This very homely conversation happens every day.",
        "Just like other ordinary and warm residents, chatting casually with close household zergs, planning what to eat and what to buy, laughing and teasing each other. ",
        "Xi Ze has hardly experienced this kind of life, obviously, there’s nothing particularly special about it, but it feels like a glass of rich and mellow golden rice wine—",
        "The saccharine fragrance filled the mouth and nose, seeping into every pore like air, enticing each cell to indulge and every nerve to relax.",
        "Xi Ze’s fingertips touched the tip of the coiled leaf of the Red Jade Vine.",
        "Just like how succulents can burst out of their pots and propagate, it serves as evidence of vigorous growth, despite being on the brink of death not long ago. ",
        "Life may be bitter, but life is tenacious.",
        "For the first time, he harbored hope.",
