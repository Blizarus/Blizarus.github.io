        "On the first day of the holidays, the weather was surprisingly sunny and cloudless. ",
        "The snow outside the balcony had melted slightly, and 015 patiently swept it away. The potted plant hidden under the small shed was moved to a sunny spot, its branches and leaves gingerly unfurling.",
        "The Red Jade Vine, translucent as crystal, resembled a miniature work of art carved from carnelian. It shimmered with a thousand colors in the warm sunlight.\n",

        "“Can you see me now?”",
        "Ye Er bent down, searching at the female zerg’s expression, waving his hand in front of him as he spoke. ",
        "The treatment was only halfway through, and it shouldn’t have taken effect so quickly. But as soon as he woke up, Xi Ze told him that he could already see a little light.\n\n",
        "Xi Ze removed his hand that was pressing on his left eye and gently clasped the male zerg’s hand.",
        "“I can only sense some light, and can’t see anything yet… but it should be soon.”",
        "His left eye, which had suffered less severe injuries, was filled with a hazy blur. He could vaguely see large patches of color, while his right eye could only perceive a faint halo of light and needed more time to recover.\n\n ",
        "“Alright.”",
        "Ye Er couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed, but after a moment of silence, he couldn’t help but smile.",
        "“This is already good. Take your time.”\n\n",
        "Xi Ze also smiled softly. “Okay.” ",
        "Before, he had been busy working every day, and even on weekends, he was busy taking the female zerg to visit the doctor. Now, with a leisurely morning, Ye Er felt a bit lost.",
        "Staying home felt boring, but he lacked the motivation to go out. After all, Aitar was a poor, backward planet with few entertainment options.",
        "“How about we watch a movie?”",
        "Ye Er had a sudden idea as he patted 015’s smooth head. ",
        "“This kind of weather is perfect for curling up at home and watching a movie, wouldn’t you say?”",
        "He glanced at Xi Ze, his expression straight as he began to ramble nonsense.",
        "“There’s a saying that to help your wounds heal faster, you need to remind your body’s healing cells of where the injuries are. Watching more movies might also stimulate your eyes and speed up their recovery…”",
        "The female zerg’s eyes showed his helplessness as he listened quietly to Ye Er’s “nonsense.” ",
        "“Do whatever you want, Male Lord, don’t worry about me.”",
        "Besides, they had watched the news together many times, so watching a movie wouldn’t be much different.",
        "Please visit chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "“Just to give you a little more involvement, you know.”",
        "Ye Er still felt that watching the news and watching movies were very different. ",
        "The former could be listened to from start to finish, while the latter involved leisure and entertainment, and the visuals were much more engaging than the sound. It was hard to enjoy it if you could only listen and not see.",
        "“What should we watch? Fhh…”",
        "Le scrolled through the homepage, feeling lost and indecisive for a while before finally settling on a highly rated film.",
        "The curtains on the balcony were drawn, but since they had a sheer diamond pattern, they didn’t block out much light. ",
        "The entire living room was bathed in a soft shadow, while the oversihed screen propection shone brightly and clearly, creating a relazed and comfortable atmosphere.",
        "Ye Er kicked off his slippers, curled up on the sofa, and began munching on a bowl of potato chips.",
        "This was one of the few snacks that 015 could make, and it always made him feel very familiar. Indeed, the love for deep-fried food could connect different dimensions and civilizations.",
        "The familiar opening sound effects of the movie, accompanied by the crunching of chips, filled the empty and quiet living room. ",
        "Xi Ze adjusted his posture, leaning back against the sofa cushion, and facing the screen.",
        "His expression was serious, but in reality… he was lost in thought.",
        "This feeling is so magical.",
        "In his busy first half of life, he never imagined that he would have a leisurely day like this. ",
        "The New Year was the busiest and most tedious time, with numerous banquet invitations fluttering in like snowflakes. Combined with the accumulated workload from the military, he barely had a moment to rest.",
        "But what occupied his mind most at this moment was not this sense of incongruity, but rather the male zerg sitting beside him, unconsciously leaning closer.",
        "The male zerg emitted a delicate, warm fragrance. His body heat, radiating through the point of contact, exuded a strong, undeniable presence.",
        "His shallow breaths and occasional, almost casual movements were more distinct than the movie’s sound effects and plot, making it impossible for him to focus on the film. ",
        "“…I really can’t agree with you guys…”",
        "A very light murmur broke his thoughts.",
        "",
        "“What?” Xi Ze snapped out of his reverie, instinctively asking.",
        "Ye Er sat up straight, not eating his potato chips anymore, frowning at the screen in front of him. ",
        "“I said, I really don’t agree with the love logic in this film.”",
        "What was the scene about just now?",
        "Xi Ze furrowed his brows and listened hard. But the scene had already passed, and now only the protagonist’s muffled sobs remained.",
        "This was already an area he was very unfamiliar with. After a moment of silence, he could only offer dry words of comfort. ",
        "“Movies are all artistically processed, and the director’s subjective style can be quite strong…so it’s completely normal not to like them.”",
        "Ye Er had never discussed such topics with anyone before, and he rarely participated in gossip exchanges with his classmates before transmigrating.",
        "After frowning for a while, he turned to look at the female zerg next to him. “What about your thoughts?”",
        "Thoughts, what thoughts? What was the movie about again? Right… the male zerg mentioned love. ",
        "Remembering the unspoken rules in the noble circle, and all kinds of vulgar and outrageous ways of playing, Xi Ze’s expression turned a bit cold.",
        "“Is there really such a thing as true love? It all stems from self-interest. It is merely a product invented by those with vested interests to disguise their ugly nature, or to justify hurting or taking from others under the guise of that golden ticket.”",
        "He stopped mid-sentence, suddenly sensing an unusual silence in the air.",
        "He realized that the person beside him wasn’t one of those pot-bellied, lecherous good-for-nothings, but rather he was a little male zerg with a gentle nature. Terrifyingly naïve and inexperienced with the world, he was likely still full of fantasies. ",
        "…He’s done for.",
        "Xi Ze suppressed the urge to sigh and do a facepalm. In the silence, he instinctively held his breath.",
        "After a while, he heard the male zerg’s hesitant and gentle voice, “…You’re right.”",
        "Ye Er stared at the protagonists on the screen, who had just finished arguing and were now back to their sweet, sticky selves. He was stunned by the female zerg’s indifferent and disgusted tone. ",
        "Easing this strange sense of dissonance, he silently continued to munch on his chips.",
        "He continued to focus on the movie, but the female zerg beside him began to feel uneasy. He adjusted positions several times, wanting to say something but unsure how to express it, while his expression grew increasingly tense.",
        "Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "After thinking for a moment, Xi Ze cautiously asked, “Then what does Male Lord think about… this, uh, love?”",
        "“Me?” ",
        "Ye Er turned his attention away from the movie, took a moment to think, and then slowly crushed a potato chip in his mouth.",
        "“I don’t have any particular thoughts, but being able to respect and understand each other and to be each other’s one and only—that’s what makes a healthy relationship.”",
        "“The Zerg race has love and marriage customs that typically involve one male zerg and multiple female zergs, which might not be suitable for me…”",
        "Ye Er vaguely expressed his stance before continuing, “Anyway, the one who could make me determined to like that zerg must be exceptional, and there should only be him, and there won’t be any situation where there will be many others.” ",
        "He didn’t know how deep the love had to be for him to cross the bottom line he had always adhered to.",
        "Actively abandoning the human part of himself, wholeheartedly accepting an “alien being”, and then fully integrating into this strange universe and world.",
        "But if that day ever came, he thought…he would face it with calm acceptance.",
        "Ye Er’s eyelashes fluttered, then he smiled lightly and diverted the topic. ",
        "“I was just asking casually. There’s no need to be so nervous. If you’re feeling bored, you can close your eyes and rest. You don’t have to force yourself to keep me company.”",
        "Xi Ze had heard the meaning behind his words just moments ago, but he couldn’t bring himself to believe it. His Adam’s apple bobbed a few times.",
        "But in the end, he didn’t ask further. He just said in a hoarse voice, “…Not forced.”",
        "They fell into silence as the hazy morning light seeped through the gaps in the curtains, and floating dust in the air sparkled with warm, tiny lights before settling down quietly. ",
        "The movie’s progress bar was already half full, and the inseparable protagonists were about to be separated by the war. As they whispered words of love to each other, a soft and mournful melody played in the background.",
        "“Eat?”",
        "A piece of something salty and fragrant brushed against his lower lip, jolting Xi Ze back to his senses. He instinctively bit down, and then the hand withdrew.",
        "The male zerg’s action was too casual, as if he didn’t realize how intimate this action was. ",
        "Being personally fed by the male lord is a privilege typically reserved for the female monarch or a favored female attendant. However, he didn’t belong to either category, but…",
        "Xi Ze slowly chewed the potato chips in his mouth.",

        "It doesn’t matter.",
        "“Eh…?” ",
        "Ye Er paused mid-bite, staring at the scene of intestines flying across the screen in the movie, almost in disbelief. He then swallowed the food in his mouth with difficulty.",
        "“How did this pass the review with such gory scenes appearing without any warning?”",
        "He turned down the volume and, feeling somewhat depressed, put it on double speed, waiting for this part to end.",
        "“It’s all props, don’t be afraid.” ",
        "Xi Ze’s expression was calm, and although he was saying comforting words, his tone was so calm that it almost seemed apathetic.",
        "“There’s no time for them to cry and whine to each other on the battlefield. A heavy-caliber weapon can take down everything in just five seconds, turning all living things into a pool of blood and mud.”",
        "This is meant to reassure him…so why does he feel even more terrified?”",
        "Ye Er remained silent, swallowing the chips in his mouth. ",
        "Then he just remembered that a military female was sitting beside him.",
        "For him, watching those scenes in the movie was like seeing a guy sitting in an ivory tower, overlooking everything, and filming the most tragic scenes he could imagine.",
        "However, it’s simply a ridiculous performance that has been infinitely glamorized.",
        "Ye Er looked at the female zerg’s profile, suddenly realizing why he chose to reconstruct his mental landscape that night. ",
        "It wasn’t that Xi Ze didn’t know what he valued. He just didn’t take it seriously.",
        "Having spent so many years living in a way that made him indifferent to his injuries and disregard the value of his body, he had ultimately developed this habit.",
        "As the female zerg said just now, the battlefield doesn’t tolerate any weakness or cowardice. Even with broken bones, you must endure through the night, as tomorrow will bring another bloody battle of survival.",
        "Ye Er furrowed his brows but didn’t comment on it. He simply spoke slowly. ",
        "“The news claims the empire is ushering in a hundred years of peace. I don’t know if it’s true. War is something that should happen less and less. It’s best if it would never happen again.”",
        "“Yes, soon, it will be… a peaceful era.”",
        "Please visit chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "Xi Ze slightly curled the corners of his lips. He seemed to be smiling, a somewhat gratified and relieved smile.",
        "However, after a while, he flattened the corners of his lips again. ",
        "“But the spirits of the martyrs have yet to find peace, a sign that unrest and revolution will never truly end.”",
        "He seemed to be implying something, but he fell silent shortly after, fumbling for the remote control to turn the sound back up.",
        "“The gore part is over. Male Lord can continue watching.”",
        "Translator’s Corner: Updates will be now twice a week, every Friday and Saturday. Thank ya’ll for sticking with me even with the super slow updates. "
