        "The next day was the official start of the competition, and tickets had already been selling steadily, with a reception more enthusiastic than expected.",
        "The show was set to begin at 8 p.m., and all the designers and their models had already started preparing backstage. ",
        "When the two Black women saw Lu Yiman, they immediately approached him nervously, asking, “Sir, we heard Dani won’t be coming, is that true?”",
        "“Yes, she won’t be coming.”\n",
        "Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "Though their relationship with Dani wasn’t close enough to warrant such anxiety, the absence of a model at the last minute would severely affect Lu Yiman’s presentation.",
        "They valued their work and didn’t want anything unexpected to happen at this point. ",
        "But his attitude remained calm.\n\n",
        "“Don’t worry, I will take care of everything. It won’t affect you in any way. All you need to do is shine on stage.”",
        "His composed demeanor quickly alleviated the anxiety of the two Black models.",
        "As models who had been left as backups, paired with such a young designer, it wouldn’t be unusual for negative assumptions to arise.\n\n ",
        "But he was so reliable. His reliability lay in the fact that he didn’t need anyone’s advice—he could handle everything on his own.",
        "He had the courage to make decisions and the ability to take responsibility.",
        "“Sir, you look truly charming,” one of the Black women suddenly said with a bright smile, her white teeth gleaming.\n\n",
        "He smiled back, winking as he said, “Thank you for the compliment.” ",
        "The tense atmosphere quietly dissipated.",
        "The Black women no longer worried about the missing model.",
        "After all, that was the designer’s problem—they only needed to be the most dazzling presence on stage.",
        "Lu Yiman stepped into the dressing room, looking at the black wedding dress in front of him. With a flick of his fingers, his braid unraveled. ",
        "***",
        "Yu Chuang entered the venue clutching a ticket, along with another gold and red invitation, which had some minor creases.",
        "It was only when he arrived that he realized the invitation would be collected and not returned, so he had to buy a ticket at the last minute—and at a high price too.",
        "Since by this time most of the tickets had already been sold out, he had bought his ticket at a high price from a scalper. ",
        "However, his assistant wasn’t as lucky.",
        "The assistant could have paid several times more, but the company wouldn’t reimburse him for that!",
        "",
        "So, he could only watch as Yu Chuang entered the venue alone.",
        "He didn’t understand why so many people were eager to watch this show, which wasn’t backed by any famous names, just like he didn’t understand why Yu Chuang was reluctant to use the invitation. ",
        "The venue was larger than expected, but at least the money wasn’t wasted. Yu Chuang’s seat was in a good spot in the front row.",
        "The show hadn’t started yet, and the audience members who had arrived were scattered about, some wandering around. Tu Jhuang had no interest in mingling and walked straight to his seat.",
        "As he sat down, he couldn’t help but wonder if, when the designer comes out with the models to take their final bow, Ou Timan would notice him sitting in this spot.",
        "Looking at the invitation in his hand, he followed the creases, folding it little by little. However, his movements were too clumsy to recreate the paper rose. ",
        "Slightly disappointed, he unfolded the invitation again, smoothed out the wrinkles, and carefully folded it before placing it back into his pocket.",
        "“Mr. Yu, I didn’t expect to run into you here.”",
        "The clear voice made his ears twitch. He turned around, only to be met with a pair of bright blue eyes.",
        "The sparkle in his eyes quickly faded. ",
        "He turned back, his face cold, now presenting only the back of his head to the speaker.",
        "Reed didn’t quite understand why Yu Chuang’s mood had suddenly soured again.",
        "But he didn’t mind. Moving closer to Yu Chuang, he said, “Mr. Yu, I didn’t expect you to be interested in fashion shows. I’m glad we share the same interests.”",
        "Yu Chuang shifted away from him, even moving seats, drawing a clear boundary between them. ",
        "In his personal time, he didn’t feel the need to maintain social etiquette with the man.",
        "Reed observed his reaction, a little puzzled by the silence.",
        "But Reed was an easygoing person. Even though Yu Chuang displayed such an attitude, he shrugged it off without concern, crossed his legs, and watched the stage with great interest.",
        "Many people in the audience recognized the young jeweler, Reed, and because of his interaction with Yu Chuang, several people turned their gaze toward Yu Chuang. ",
        "Sensing their stares, Yu Chuang swept them with a cold glance, and they quickly looked away out of courtesy.",
        "As the last minute before the show ticked away, numerous spotlights lit up, and the guests who had been lingering politely took their seats.",
        "Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "The first model walked out.",
        "She was a strikingly beautiful white model, wearing a sheer, flowing gown that accentuated her curves in an eye-catching way. Every movement she made exuded an alluring grace that captivated the audience. ",
        "Watching these stunning models on the runway was indeed a visual feast.",
        "As one model after another appeared, the room grew quiet, the audience’s breathing almost audible, as everyone watched with appreciation.",
        "Among them, only Yu Chuang’s gaze remained calm.",
        "“They’re beautiful, aren’t they? Whether it’s the jewelry or the clothes, they both possess an enchanting magic.” ",
        "Yu Chuang glanced at Reed.",
        "He had assumed Reed was focused on the models, but it turned out he was genuinely appreciating the designers’ work.",
        "“Wow!”",
        "Soft gasps of amazement echoed around the room. ",
        "He looked toward the stage as two Black models walked out, one following the other.",
        "They were tall and slim, with long necks, smooth and shiny black skin, and their red floor-length gowns were impossibly luxurious. The contrast between the black and red created a striking visual impact.",
        "However, what caused the audience’s gasps were the gold and red body paintings on the models, which started at their chests and extended up their necks, forming vivid roses blooming across their skin.",
        "It was both beautiful and astonishing. ",
        "It was as if the red gowns were the most radiant flowers in full bloom, while the models themselves were the strong, lively stems.",
        "From the moment the two models appeared, Yu Chuang’s pupils began to tremble.",
        "Even Reed, who had been immersed in admiring the show, slowly showed a strange expression. He studied the patterns on the models, then suddenly turned his head to look at Yu Chuang’s neck.",
        "There, the mysterious and intricate tattoo of vines and dark red flowers intertwined, but now, the flower on Yu Chuang’s neck, once ambiguous in shape, had fully bloomed into a rose. ",
        "Yu Chuang sat up straight, his throat involuntarily moving as he swallowed, his gaze fixed on the models on the stage. His heart began to race uncontrollably.",
        "From the first moment he saw it, he knew this was Lu Yiman’s work.",
        "Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "He was so certain of it, and while the rest of the audience was still admiring the beauty of the show, he was already feeling a mix of nervousness and excitement, holding onto this little secret.",
        "Reed watched him in surprise, noticing the light in his eyes, and then looked thoughtfully back at the stage. ",
        "Following the two Black models, a stark and striking figure emerged—a combination of black and white that was impossible to miss.",
        "A black wedding gown, pale skin, a billowing skirt, and soft, wavy shoulder-length hair.",
        "The figure was taller than all the other models, with a build that wasn’t particularly delicate but firm and strong. Waves of hair obscured part of the model’s face, revealing only a mesmerizing almond-shaped eye, a high nose bridge, and slightly pursed lips.",
        "Given the right attributes, why couldn’t a designer also be a model? ",
        "Just like any of his works, he could be his own masterpiece.",
        "In the back row, Dani, dressed casually, covered her mouth in surprise.",
        "She couldn’t help but stand up, her eyes wide open. But at that moment, no one paid attention to her because her seat was too inconspicuous, and everyone’s eyes were glued to the model on the stage.",
        "Everyone knew that this was a man. ",
        "But they also knew that this man was beautiful.",
        "Lu Yiman walked to the center of the stage, his cold and striking face exuding an untouchable elegance, yet the mystery and aloofness about him only made it harder for anyone to look away.",
        "Suddenly, he lowered his head and smiled in a particular direction.",
        "The divine, sacred aura of black and white was immediately shattered, and the cold, aloof demeanor broke, replaced by a playful hint of raw, primal desire. ",
        "That brief eye contact with Lu Yiman made Yu Chuang’s heart race to its peak. He stared intently at the smile on Lu Yiman’s face, his heartbeat pounding wildly.",
        "Until now, there had been a key hidden in his heart, one he had thrown away.",
        "But now, he felt like he needed a sturdier lock.",
        "He wanted to keep Lu Yiman to himself. ",
        "He licked his lips, a faint blush coloring his cheekbones, making him look as if he had been drinking.",
        "When Lu Yiman passed by his seat, he glanced back at Yu Chuang, his eyes gleaming, and gave him a mysterious, ambiguous smile.",
        "",
        "And as he walked by, he left behind a single high heel.",
        "Oh my! He’s teasing him! ",
        "All eyes in the room turned to Yu Chuang at once.",
        "Yu Chuang’s hand, resting on his leg, clenched slightly, his gaze fixed on the high heel, an intense desire to grab it and hide it surging within him.",
        "But the staff quickly came and picked it up.",
        "He looked slightly disappointed. ",
        "***",
        "Finally, it was time for the designers to come out and take their bows with their models.",
        "Young, handsome designers stood confidently among their models, bringing an energetic vibrancy to the show.",
        "When Lu Yiman appeared, the crowd erupted in surprise. ",
        "“Black Swan.”",
        "Yes, they had given this beautiful man a new name.",
        "The mysterious and elegant Black Swan.",
        "His wavy long hair still covered half of his face, adding to his beauty and grace. ",
        "Even while wearing such an elaborate bridal gown, his calm and natural posture added a unique charm to him.",
        "Holding the hands of the two Black models, he politely and warmly bowed to the audience.",
        "He didn’t seem like an unknown, up-and-coming designer at all.",
        "He was too composed. ",
        "As if no problem could ever faze him.",
        "Lu Yiman could feel the eyes on him from all directions, but one gaze stood out.",
        "Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "It was filled with focus and intense heat, wrapping around him, intertwining into a clear and straightforward desire.",
        "He glanced out of the corner of his eye, a slight curve forming at the corner of his lips. "
