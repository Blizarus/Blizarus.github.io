        "When Peng Duoduo arrived at the West Street bar, he was already nearly an hour late.",
        "But he still leisurely adjusted the small tuft of red hair at his forehead, then walked inside with the unmistakable aura of a rich and carefree young man. ",
        "With just a glance, his eyes landed on the man sitting at the bar, holding a glass of alcohol.",
        "The man was tall but a bit thin, and sitting on the high stool made his waist appear even slimmer and his legs longer.\n",
        "",
        "His drinking motions were slow and unhurried, naturally exuding an appealing air of grace and elegance.",
        "Perhaps people in the arts possess a unique charm. His outfit was casual yet distinctive: a white shirt with a Mandarin collar and knotted buttons, paired with loose-fitting pants that had a long chain hanging from the waist, making him appear both slender and artistic, with a hint of lazy nonchalance. ",
        "His hair was medium-length, short on top and longer below, with a single finger-length braid at the back of his neck, adding a touch of youthful vibrancy. Such a unique hairstyle would be hard to pull off without good looks, and it also requires constant care.\n\n",
        "Fortunately, he was good-looking, and always kept himself clean and well-groomed at all times.",
        "Noticing Peng Duoduo’s gaze, the man looked over, his beautiful almond-shaped eyes carrying a faint smile, soft and intoxicating under the ambient light.",
        "Peng Duoduo could already hear the gasps around him, as well as the greedy gazes circling the man.\n\n ",
        "As for what they were after, it was obviously his looks.",
        "He tugged at his red hair again, feeling that the color he specially dyed gave him a bit more confidence, and then walked over with his chest puffed out, full of bravado.",
        "“Peng Duoduo.”\n\n",
        "His face fell. “Yiman, you never used to call me by my full name.” ",
        "About a month ago, this friend of his had fallen down a hillside while doing plein air painting.",
        "This reclusive loner had stayed in the hospital for a month, and no one knew about it.",
        "By the time Peng Duoduo found out, the man had already quietly returned home. It was said that the fall had even damaged his brain.",
        "But Peng Duoduo felt that the change was for the better. After all, in the past, he used to have long hair, wear black-framed glasses, and stay pale and gloomy, absorbed in his own world, no matter how handsome his face was, it lost some of its charm. ",
        "Now, just standing there, his alluring aura could blind people.",
        "The only downside was that “Duoduo” had turned into “Peng Duoduo.”",
        "Lu Yiman smiled. His full, rosy lips looked very attractive when they curved up. Although his gentle scholarly demeanor carried a hint of melancholy, ever since he had taken off those rimless glasses, his almond eyes narrowed slightly, making people want to kneel before him and say, “Daddy, hit me!”",
        "Even though he considered himself to have no such inclinations and always treated people with courtesy and respect. ",
        "“It doesn’t matter what I call you.” His pale, slender fingers clinked his glass against Peng Duoduo’s with a crisp sound, then he tilted his neck back and sipped his drink, his Adam’s apple moving slightly.",
        "Peng Duoduo winced and hissed in pain, feeling the wolf-like stares around them. He clicked his tongue and said, “Please stop radiating your charm.”",
        "Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "Le suddenly thought that the introverted shut-in from before was better.",
        "At least back then, when he stood nezt to him, he didn’t feel like he had no presence at all, like air. ",
        "“Lmm?” Ou Timan turned to look at him, his almond-shaped eyes shining under the flickering light.",
        "Peng Duoduo covered his own eyes and raised a hand to push him away.",
        "“So, what brings you to West Street today? Don’t tell me you’ve finally decided to give up on your first love and break free of your innocence?”",
        "Peng Duoduo’s gaze swept over the men and women in the dance floor, and he clicked his tongue, sighing a few times. ",
        "Lu Yiman wasn’t angry at being pushed away. His eyes still carried a bit of a smile, with a touch of gentle affection.",
        "“How can it be as exaggerated as you make it sound? Isn’t it normal for adults to go out and enjoy some nightlife?”",
        "Peng Duoduo looked at him in surprise. “This really doesn’t sound like something you would say. Could it be that you’re giving up on true love, devastated, and now decided to throw yourself into a life of debauchery?”",
        "Lu Yiman didn’t respond, only chuckling softly as he gazed at the liquor in his glass. ",
        "The “true love” Peng Duoduo mentioned was indeed “Lu Yiman’s” true love, but it wasn’t his own.",
        "In a strange twist, one ordinary day, his hand slipped and clicked on an advertisement, which opened up a novel about two protagonists—Yu Chuang and Yu Ziming.",
        "But what caught his attention immediately was a supporting character named “Lu Yiman,” who was said to be the first love of the protagonist Yu Ziming.",
        "Same name, same gender, and an eerily similar life story piqued his interest. ",
        "The only difference was that this “Lu Yiman” had a family.",
        "The novel mostly revolved around the two protagonists’ complex love story. One running away, the other chasing after him, in an endless cycle. Halfway through reading, he found the arguments in the comment section more entertaining than the novel itself.",
        "One group passionately shipped the two protagonists, writing endless emotional essays about their love.",
        "The other group felt sympathy for Yu Ziming, arguing that Yu Chuang’s overbearing and possessive love was suffocating. They hoped that Yu Ziming’s first love, Lu Yiman, could save him from this misery. ",
        "Lu Yiman would often just lurk in the comments, never reading more of the novel, only watching the fans argue. Strangely enough, he preferred the silent, inarticulate Yu Chuang over the innocent Yu Ziming.",
        "Yu Chuang’s love was like a blazing fire, intense enough to consume someone completely, body and soul.",
        "Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "As he stared at the dim and bright reflections in his eyes on the screen, a pop-up appeared as if by fate, asking if he would like to save the protagonist.",
        "There was no hacking involved, no system error. ",
        "After a moment of hesitation, he allowed himself to accept this strange occurrence. After all, a mundane and dull life needs a bit of excitement to make it more interesting.",
        "So, he chose “yes.”",
        "And thus, he became “Lu Yiman,” the first love of Yu Ziming.",
        "Fingers swirling the glass, he watched as the transparent ice cubes clinked against the sides, and the amber liquor shimmered under the light. He took a gentle sip, feeling the light intoxication setting in. ",
        "Midnight had arrived.",
        "His long legs touched the ground, and he pushed the high stool back with his heel. Grabbing the coat draped over the chair, he half-closed his eyes and said, “I’m leaving.”",
        "Peng Duoduo had just started to taste his drink and was surprised to see him ready to leave. “Weren’t you planning to enjoy some adult nightlife?”",
        "Lu Yiman turned his head, his chiseled profile bathed in the flickering light, looking so sexy that it made one’s heart race. ",
        "He smiled slightly and said, “One drink doesn’t count as nightlife?”",
        "Peng Duoduo blinked, and when he refocused, Lu Yiman’s tall and slender figure had already vanished into the crowd.",
        "Startled for a moment, Peng Duoduo slapped the table and cursed, “Damn, that guy made me come just to pay the bill!”",
        "Furious, he downed the rest of his drink in one gulp. ",
        "***",
        "As Lu Yiman stepped out of the bar, the cool night air dispelled the murky, chaotic atmosphere inside.",
        "He slung his thin black trench coat over one shoulder, holding a cigarette between his fingers. Passersby glanced at him, their eyes lingering, unable to look away, as the warm streetlight highlighted the refined and cool sharpness of his face.",
        "Lowering his head, he flicked the lighter. Just as he was about to light the cigarette, the lighter slipped from his hand, as if someone had timed it perfectly. ",
        "With the cigarette still in his mouth, he reached out and grabbed the arm of the person approaching.",
        "The person bumped right into his chest and looked up, revealing a clean, handsome face that lit up with surprise upon seeing him.",
        "",
        "“Yiman-ge!”",
        "He held the other person’s arm, steadying him, and just happened to create some space between their chests. ",
        "“Yu… Ziming.” He took the cigarette out of his mouth. “What are you doing here?”",
        "“I…” Yu Ziming lowered his head, his thin shoulders shivering slightly in the night wind.",
        "Lu Yiman unfolded his coat and draped it over Yu Ziming’s shoulders, which were only covered by a T-shirt.",
        "Yu Ziming’s tense expression relaxed, and the look he gave Lu Yiman now carried a hint of warmth. ",
        "But soon, he seemed to recall something, and his slightly pale lips pressed together tightly as he turned his head away, appearing both vulnerable and distressed.",
        "“Yiman-ge, do you… do you live alone? If it’s convenient, could I—”",
        "Before he could finish, a completely black car screeched to a halt on the street with a sharp, jarring sound.",
        "Yu Ziming immediately swallowed the rest of his words, and even a trace of fear appeared on his face as he moved closer to Lu Yiman for protection. ",
        "This dramatic scene made Lu Yiman raise an eyebrow, but his attention was quickly drawn to the long legs stepping out of the car.",
        "A man dressed in a pitch-black suit emerged, and even before his face became clear, the oppressive, dark aura that clung to him made it hard to breathe.",
        "He was tall and upright, with broad shoulders, a narrow waist, and long legs, radiating a natural air of authority.",
        "When Lu Yiman finally saw his face, he noticed the man had slightly high brow bones, deep-set eyes, and narrow, sharp phoenix eyes that were colder than most, with a hint of gloominess. His high nose and sharp jawline gave him a dangerous, unapproachable appearance. ",
        "Lu Yiman’s gaze slowly moved down to the man’s neck.",
        "There, an eye-catching tattoo wrapped around his Adam’s apple—a vine with dark red flowers coiling around his neck. It was inked in such a fragile spot because it covered a prominent scar on his Adam’s apple, a scar that would never fully fade.",
        "Instinctively, Lu Yiman raised his hand, the cigarette still between his fingers. Though it wasn’t lit, the faint scent of tobacco filled the air.",
        "The novel once described Yu Chuang like this: ",
        "—He possessed the natural nobility of an aristocrat but also the wildness of someone constantly struggling between chaos and order.",
        "But to Lu Yiman, this version of Yu Chuang was beautiful.",
        "Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "His teeth bit down on the cigarette filter, the taste of saliva mixed with tobacco. As Yu Chuang walked toward them under the cold streetlight, his dark, hawk-like eyes flicked from Yu Ziming to focus intently on Lu Yiman.",
        "This was not good. ",
        "Their first meeting, and he was already being mistaken for the “other man.”",
        "A strong hand gripped his shoulder, while Yu Ziming still clung to his forearm.",
        "The proximity brought Yu Chuang’s face uncomfortably close, creating a moment of undeniable tension.",
        "The alcohol Lu Yiman had just drunk started to ferment in his system. He grabbed Yu Chuang’s wrist in return, surprised by the warmth of the man’s skin against his cold fingers. ",
        "He parted his lips, his eyes slightly dazed and shimmering.",
        "“Mr. Yu, nice to meet you.”",
