        "Before he could finish his sentence, still smiling, Yu Chuang had already wrapped his arms around his neck and kissed him.",
        "The kiss was desperate, filled with Yu Chuang’s uncontainable desire for him. ",
        "Lu Yiman was pulled inside, the door slamming shut behind them with a loud “bang,” startling the motion-activated lights in the hallway.",
        "Back pressed against the wall, Lu Yiman placed one hand on Yu Chuang’s waist, letting him press against him with reckless, impulsive kisses.\n",
        "Please visit chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "There was no rhythm to Yu Chuang’s kisses, just messy licks on his lips, breathing erratic and hot.",
        "Lu Yiman’s calm eyes deepened as the kiss went on. ",
        "With a sudden move, he grabbed Yu Chuang’s waist and pinned him against the wall. Being slightly taller than Yu Chuang, Lu Yiman had to lower his head to look at him, easily enveloping him in his gaze.\n\n",
        "He took control of the rhythm, and his kisses carried the sensuality and danger of an adult man, filled with both desire and temptation.",
        "As soon as Lu Yiman slipped his hand under Yu Chuang’s shirt, Yu Chuang’s body trembled, his waist softening as he clung to him.",
        "Yu Chuang was lost in the kiss, completely immersed in it.\n\n ",
        "Even when Lu Yiman tried to pull away, Yu Chuang held onto his neck, chasing after his lips.",
        "Only when he felt Lu Yiman’s lips again did Yu Chuang finally relax, pressing against him with complete attachment.",
        "Lu Yiman looked down at his dazed eyes, and as Yu Chuang instinctively opened his mouth for another kiss, he gave him a deep one. He slowly pulled back, leaving soft pecks as Yu Chuang trembled.\n\n",
        "The intimate action gradually calmed Yu Chuang down. As Lu Yiman pecked at his lips, Yu Chuang cooperatively puckered his own, waiting for the next kiss. ",
        "There was a smile in his eyes, and his fingers slowly rubbed Yu Chuang’s waist under his shirt.",
        "Yu Chuang was very sensitive, and any spot that could provoke a feeling would get a reaction from him.",
        "Because of this, he kept trembling lightly, with a pink flush spreading across his neck.",
        "He was a man who, from his appearance, would never give off a weak or delicate impression. ",
        "But in moments of affection, he had all the adorable reactions.",
        "“More.”",
        "Yu Chuang opened his slightly hazy eyes. Just from having his waist touched, he almost couldn’t stand, but he was still persistent in pushing himself closer.",
        "Pressing against Lu Yiman’s body, his face was red, but he was honestly showing his natural, instinctive reactions. ",
        "Lu Yiman noticed this.",
        "He grasped Yu Chuang’s waist, and as Yu Chuang’s body trembled and rubbed against him, he exerted a little force to stop Yu Chuang from pushing further against him.",
        "",
        "Yu Chuang stared at him, not blinking, shy yet sincere.",
        "He bit his lip, and after a long silence, he opened his mouth, “I’ll help you.” ",
        "At the same time, he turned Yu Chuang around by the shoulders, facing him towards the wall, preventing him from seeing the expression on his face.",
        "One hand pressed on Yu Chuang’s back while the other moved to the front of his shirt, neither letting him get too close nor pushing him too far away.",
        "Yu Chuang, apart from feeling his hands, could only sense his breathing, but no longer feel any warmth from his body.",
        "Xrowing anzious, he bit his lips tightly. ",
        "When Ou Timan grasped his waist, he realihed that Tu Jhuang’s shirt, though it had come slightly undone, was still tucked neatly into his pants.",
        "“Are you wearing a shirt garter?”",
        "Le tugged at a belt, and when he let it go, it snapped back and hit Tu Jhuang’s leg.",
        "Yu Chuang shuddered slightly, lowering his head and softly replied, “Yes.” ",
        "He practically wore formal attire every day, and naturally, he always managed himself in the most presentable way.",
        "It had nothing to do with being in a work environment; this was simply how he conducted himself in daily life.",
        "Lu Yiman had only seen him once without his usual formal wear—he had worn a black jacket, but even then, his shirt underneath was neatly pressed.",
        "“If I don’t wear it, it wrinkles.” ",
        "The back of Yu Chuang’s neck flushed a deep red.",
        "Lu Yiman gazed at that patch of skin, thinking it would be just right to kiss it, but he didn’t move.",
        "Yu Chuang’s tie hung loosely around his neck, and his belt was half undone, barely hanging onto his waist. His hands, propped against the wall, trembled, unable to hold steady.",
        "Standing behind him, Lu Yiman was impeccably dressed, like a preacher, with even the top button of his collar fastened tightly around his throat. ",
        "In the end, Yu Chuang hoarsely called out his name.",
        "“Lu Yiman.”",
        "",
        "Lu Yiman lowered his gaze to him, his Adam’s apple moved, and he dryly responded with a single word.",
        "“Yes.” ",
        "***",
        "Yu Chuang hadn’t slept this deeply in a long time. The room had no incense, only a faint scent of tobacco.",
        "He couldn’t quite remember how he fell asleep last night, but he remembered Lu Yiman staying by his side the entire time.",
        "When he opened his eyes, he was the only one in the room. Lu Yiman was gone. ",
        "A ray of sunlight broke through the clouds outside the window, and the air was refreshing, though it carried a faint chill, suggesting that winter was approaching.",
        "He lifted the blanket and got out of bed, opening the door to find Lu Yiman sitting on the balcony reading a book. He was wearing long pants and a knitted cardigan, with a pair of frameless glasses resting on the bridge of his nose.",
        "Lu Yiman wasn’t very nearsighted; he only wore glasses occasionally.",
        "In this state, Lu Yiman seemed like a different person, transforming from the gentle, handsome man he usually was into someone more distant, colder, more restrained. He was still elegant, but now it felt as if the glasses hid some secret that no one was allowed to see. ",
        "Yu Chuang silently watched him, carefully engraving his appearance into his heart.",
        "Sensing Yu Chuang’s gaze, Lu Yiman turned to look at him, a smile forming on his face.",
        "“You’re up. Did you sleep well?”",
        "His eyes were hidden behind the lenses, making his smile appear tinged with a bit of mystery. ",
        "Yu Chuang was stunned for a moment, then nodded.",
        "“Very well.”",
        "He had never slept so peacefully, even his nightmares had disappeared.",
        "“It’s already 8 o’clock. Do you need to go out?” Lu Yiman glanced at the time and asked softly. ",
        "Yu Chuang paused, suddenly remembering he had an appointment today.",
        "He clenched his hands but then paused again, lowering his head to see the bandage on his fingers had been freshly wrapped.",
        "Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "This made his Adam’s apple move, but the words stuck in his mouth for a long time.",
        "In the end, he closed his eyes and simply said, “Mm.” ",
        "Yu Chuang left alone, not even having breakfast, and Lu Yiman hadn’t prepared any for him either. It seemed as though Lu Yiman had tacitly accepted this.",
        "After the door closed, the wind blew the black tie hanging on the balcony. Lu Yiman lowered his head, watching Yu Chuang’s retreating figure, and with a “snap,” he closed the book in his hands.",
        "***",
        "Sitting in the office, Yu Chuan couldn’t focus on the documents in front of him, constantly feeling an anxious restlessness gnawing at him. ",
        "Even the ticking of each minute on the clock became unbearable.",
        "Finally, he stood up. The secretary, who had just come in to inform him of a meeting, was surprised to see him about to leave and couldn’t help but remind him, “Mr. Yu, there’s a meeting with Manager Yu soon…”",
        "Yu Chuan shot him a sharp glance and coldly said, “Let him wait.”",
        "Without another word, he strode out the door without looking back. ",
        "As Yu Chuan sat in the car, the irritation in his heart nearly reached its peak. The driver, sensing his mood, didn’t dare to ask any questions and drove silently to the designated address.",
        "The morning rush in the capital was busy, with heavy traffic, honking horns, and endless red lights, all of which made Yu Chuan’s expression grow darker and darker.",
        "These were things he encountered daily and had long been accustomed to, but today they became unbearable.",
        "At one red light, when a car behind them started honking impatiently, the veins on Yu Chuan’s forehead throbbed. With a cold face, he opened the car door and stormed toward the vehicle behind them. ",
        "The driver was startled and quickly followed him out of the car, while the people in the other vehicle looked at Yu Chuan’s dark expression with a mix of confusion and wariness.",
        "When he reached the car, the frustration churning inside Yu Chuan nearly consumed him.",
        "But then, suddenly, he calmed down.",
        "What was he doing? Losing all self-control? Was he really going to lash out at a random stranger? ",
        "His heart felt empty for a moment. He lowered his eyes and stood there quietly for a while before turning around and walking back to his car.",
        "Once he got back inside, the car behind them visibly relaxed, and the driver quickly apologized on his behalf.",
        "Please visit chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "As they slowly drove away, the surrounding vehicles discreetly moved farther from them.",
        "If they accidentally scratched a car like that, they could lose everything trying to pay for the damage! ",
        "***",
        "“Mr. Yu, we’ve arrived.”",
        "The driver hesitated before gently reminding Yu Chuan in the backseat.",
        "Lost in his thoughts, Yu Chuan snapped back to reality when he heard the words. His heart immediately tightened. ",
        "He gripped the door handle for a long moment before taking a deep breath and stepping out of the car.",
        "Across the street at the café sat a man in formal attire, handsome and cold.",
        "He sat there alone, the seat opposite him vacant.",
        "Yu Chuan’s pupils contracted sharply, and he pursed his lips, not even daring to blink. ",
        "Who did the Gao family think they were? How dare they stand his brother up!",
        "But when he saw Yu Chuang gazing calmly and peacefully out of the window, his heart wavered and was quickly overtaken by a sense of desolation.",
        "And who was he, really?",
        "If he had just a bit more courage, Yu Chuang wouldn’t be sitting there alone today. ",
        "But for him, it wasn’t the immense pressure from Old Master Yu that was the hardest to bear—it was the insurmountable barrier within his own heart.",
        "He couldn’t accept, nor could he endure, even the slightest possibility that Yu Chuang might leave him.",
        "“Hello, Mr. Yu.”",
        "A familiar voice made Yu Chuan startle violently. He looked up in shock to see Lu Yiman sitting just one seat away. ",
        "“What are you doing here?”",
        "Lu Yiman smiled faintly, turning his head toward the café across the street. “I came all this way. Thought I’d have a cup of coffee.”",
        "Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "Then, taking his eyes off Yu Chuang, he looked back at Yu Chuan and blinked. “But the coffee there isn’t as good as it is here. It just goes to show that Mr. Yu has better taste in his choices than Yu Chuang does.”",
        "It was like being slapped in the face. Yu Chuan shot to his feet, but after considering something, he forced himself to sit back down. ",
        "He took a deep breath to keep his composure, then stood again, walking over to the seat across from Lu Yiman, remembering to bring his coffee with him.",
        "The memory of their last confrontation was still fresh—he had lost, completely.",
        "But he knew this wasn’t a matter that could be determined by victory or defeat.",
        "“Lu Yiman, I understand what you’re getting at, but why should it be you warning me?” ",
        "His gaze bore into Lu Yiman, eyes brimming with anger.",
        "Lu Yiman, however, remained calm, sitting with his legs crossed and leaning back slightly. His effortless posture exuded a natural air of superiority, quietly asserting dominance.",
        "“Because you’re testing my patience,” Lu Yiman said lightly.",
