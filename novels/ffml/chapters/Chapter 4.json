        "As he walked to the Chen family’s main entrance, the bright lights from inside extended all the way outside. Just as he stepped in, a little girl wearing a blue-and-white school uniform had already stood up.",
        "“Brother!” A crisp and sweet voice called out, momentarily making him think of the little girl he met when he was seventeen. ",
        "“Hmm.”",
        "He nodded slightly, quickly pulling his thoughts back together as he walked in with a calm demeanor.\n",
        "",
        "Chen Zizi, on the other hand, looked surprised, but her face immediately lit up with delight.",
        "She eagerly pulled out a chair and, like a busy little bird, hovered around him, chattering away and inviting him to sit down. ",
        "At seventeen, it seemed she was developing a bit slower, or perhaps Lu Yiman was just too tall, as she barely reached his chest.\n\n",
        "She was also different from the wealthy girls of the same age, with no makeup, no fancy clothes. Her ponytail was tied neatly, and she was still wearing her school uniform, looking like a slim and lively student.",
        "“Brother, I did better on this month’s exam than last time. The teacher said if I keep it up, I might get into Beijing University.”",
        "She smiled, revealing a dimple, her round almond-shaped eyes curving into crescents.\n\n ",
        "“Brother, that’s your alma mater, isn’t it? I heard there’s a peach blossom forest there, and in spring, it’s filled with flowers, so beautiful! Lots of people go there to fall in love!”",
        "A tall man carrying a bowl of food chuckled lightly, warning her, “You’re still so young, already thinking about falling in love? Let me tell you, even if you get into university, you’d better focus on your studies first.”",
        "Although the Chen family couldn’t compare to the most elite families, they were still well-off, but their household was surprisingly simple and strict.\n\n",
        "You could tell just by looking at the small two-story villa and Chen Zizi still in her school uniform. ",
        "“Why? I’ll be eighteen by the time I get into university!”",
        "“Because I’m your father,” Mr. Chen said, taking off his apron, fully embracing his role as a strict father.",
        "“But you didn’t watch over brother so strictly when he was in university!” Chen Zizi retorted, but after speaking, she quickly quieted down, carefully glancing at his expression.",
        "He sat upright in the chair, his lips pressed into a faint smile, “Probably because I’m a boy, and it’s not as easy for me to suffer losses, right?” ",
        "This remark even made Mr. Chen look at him in surprise, but soon his face broke into a smile, the corners of his eyes relaxing with a few wrinkles.",
        "“Your brother’s right. If only you were as easy to take care of as him.”",
        "Chen Zizi paused for a moment, her face lighting up with a playful expression.",
        "“I’m not difficult!” ",
        "“Hmph, if you were easy to manage, your teacher wouldn’t have called me to say you skipped evening study and snuck out!”",
        "Chen Zizi immediately coughed and muttered quietly, “I wasn’t doing anything bad.”",
        "Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "In fact, Chen Zizi’s grades were never something to worry about, but her mischievous nature made it hard for people to feel at ease.",
        "Her eyes darted around, and she dragged a heavy chair over to sit beside Lu Yiman, humming as she said, “I’ll sit with my brother today, so you can’t criticize me!” ",
        "After speaking, she blinked her large eyes at him, but when he looked over, she shyly averted her gaze, shifting nervously in her chair.",
        "Unfortunately, Mr. Chen wasn’t about to spare her, chuckling, “Sitting with your brother, why are you blushing? Is it because I called you out for sneaking out, and now you’re embarrassed in front of him?”",
        "Chen Zizi’s face immediately turned bright red, and she flailed her arms in frustration.",
        "“Tou’re so mean, I’m not talking to you anymore!” ",
        "Ler antics made the housekeeper and maid laugh, and even Zr. Jhen couldn’t help but chuckle.",
        "Ou Timan’s face held a gentle ezpression as he moved the bowls and chopsticks on the table in front of her, not refusing her closeness.",
        "Originally, Chen Zizi had been laughing and getting flustered, but seeing his actions, she immediately sat upright, behaving like a well-mannered child in her brother’s eyes.",
        "Little did she know, her behavior made Mr. Chen laugh even harder. ",
        "“What’s the occasion? You all seem so happy.”",
        "A soft and gentle voice sounded. Mr. Chen smiled warmly and replied, “We’re laughing at how even thick-skinned Zizi knows to keep up her appearance in front of her brother.”",
        "Mrs. Song’s eyes lit up when she saw the two children sitting side by side. Her eyes welled up with tears as she covered her mouth, her voice trembling, “That’s how it should be… it should be… Zizi is growing up.”",
        "She didn’t dare make any unusual sounds, her emotions surging. After she forced down the intense feeling, she walked toward the dining table. ",
        "It was only at this point that Lu Yiman raised his head to look at her.",
        "It was hard to tell if it was disappointment or relief.",
        "She didn’t resemble the mother he remembered.",
        "That was right—he was Lu Yiman, but not the “Lu Yiman.” ",
        "His expression remained unchanged, but as the cold, withdrawn facade faded away, his handsome features and natural charm gradually came to light.",
        "Even though he wasn’t Mr. Chen’s biological son, his distinguished appearance and calm demeanor always made people feel an inexplicable sense of closeness.",
        "Please visit chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "“I’ve heard Yiman’s brand is doing better and better.”",
        "Mr. Chen looked at him kindly. ",
        "After all, there was a layer of distance between them, and due to Mrs. Song’s feelings of guilt, he had a great deal of personal freedom.",
        "“It’s doing alright. I also brought a gift for Zizi today.”",
        "Hearing there was a gift, Chen Zizi’s eyes widened with delight.",
        "“Really?” ",
        "He nodded and handed over a gift box wrapped in pink ribbon.",
        "This was a gift “Lu Yiman” had prepared a month ago. He hadn’t discarded the thought behind it.",
        "No matter how “Lu Yiman” felt about his place in this family, deep down, he still had some affection for them.",
        "Chen Zizi eagerly opened the box, revealing a white dress sparkling with stardust, its bright and fluffy skirt resembling a galaxy. ",
        "It was even more stunning than expected, a testament to the effort that had been put into it.",
        "Even someone as outgoing and carefree as Chen Zizi became careful, her eyes turning red as she held the dress. After a long pause, she whispered, “Thank you, brother. I love it.”",
        "He smiled kindly. “I hope you blossom like the most beautiful flower in the prime of your youth.”",
        "This was the message he had left in the gift box. ",
        "…",
        "In all these years, the Chen household had never felt as harmonious as it did today.",
        "That princess dress had completely won over young Chen Zizi. She sat by Lu Yiman’s side, constantly offering him food, and even when dividing the cake, she gave him the biggest piece.",
        "Mr. Chen teased her, but the smile never left his eyes. Mrs. Song, too, had red eyes from the start, unable to speak easily. ",
        "Lu Yiman remained calm and unhurried, his serene, peach-blossom eyes showing no emotion.",
        "He acted like a polite gentleman, carefully preserving everyone’s dignity and face.",
        "",
        "But that was all.",
        "“Y-Yiman, stay the night today,” Mrs. Song said nervously, looking at him. ",
        "There was a room for him here, though he had only lived in it for a year. After coming of age, he had moved out to live on his own.",
        "He looked at her quietly, at her now-aging face gazing at him with anxious, trembling eyes filled with a hidden hope.",
        "Neither Mr. Chen nor Chen Zizi said anything, but their expectant eyes turned toward him as well.",
        "He remained silent for a long time. Everyone thought he wouldn’t refuse, seeing the gentle look in his eyes. ",
        "After all, today was indeed special.",
        "He gently opened his mouth, the smile in his eyes unwavering.",
        "“No.”",
        "Mrs. Song’s pupils trembled, her mouth opened slightly, as if she hadn’t processed it yet, but he didn’t elaborate further. ",
        "He nodded politely, pushed back his chair, and stood up.",
        "Dinner had been eaten, the cake had been cut, and the gift had been given. It was time for him to go home.",
        "“Thank you for the hospitality, but it’s getting late, and I have work to deal with, so I won’t stay longer.”",
        "It took a while for the silent air to start flowing again. ",
        "Chen Zizi opened her mouth, but the usually eloquent girl found herself unable to speak.",
        "Mrs. Song’s trembling lips also couldn’t form any words.",
        "After a quiet pause, Mr. Chen was the first to sigh and speak calmly, “In the future, if you have time, visit more often.”",
        "He smiled and nodded, without refusing. ",
        "“I… I’ll have Mr. Wang drive you,” Mrs. Song said stiffly, her face pale.",
        "“All right.”",
        "",
        "He nodded in agreement, and Mrs. Song forced a smile, though her expression didn’t look much better.",
        "Just as he lifted his foot to leave, his phone displayed an incoming call from an unknown number. ",
        "He didn’t have the habit of answering unfamiliar numbers and quickly hung up.",
        "But within seconds, the call came through again. He declined it once more, but the phone rang yet again. The unfamiliar number flashed persistently on the screen.",
        "Raising an eyebrow, he slid his finger across the screen.",
        "——“Lu Yiman!” ",
        "The slightly tingling sensation in his ear carried the anger from the other end of the line straight to him.",
        "“Good evening, Mr. Yu,” he greeted with a smile.",
        "Mrs. Song, who had been about to see him off, glanced at his raised eyebrow in surprise.",
        "——“Where is Ziming?” ",
        "His eyes flickered slightly. In less than a day, the person had already disappeared.",
        "“Mr. Yu, I don’t understand what you mean.”",
        "He gave Mrs. Song an apologetic look and smiled helplessly. Mrs. Song froze for a moment, then quickly shook her head in understanding.",
        "He nodded politely in apology and took long strides to leave. ",
        "Mrs. Song watched his back, no longer insisting that the driver take him.",
        "…",
        "Walking alone into the night outside the neighborhood, the streets were busy with traffic but not many pedestrians. The streetlights and the flashing car headlights intertwined, casting a blend of light and shadow.",
        "On the other end of the line, Yu Chuang’s heavy breathing could be heard through the phone, along with his slow, deliberate words. ",
        "——“It was you!”",
        "The distorted phone call carried a hoarse voice with a certain magnetism.",
        "Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "He narrowed his eyes slightly, suddenly feeling the urge to light a cigarette.",
        "“Mr. Yu, don’t forget, you left me on the beach last night. How could it have been me?” ",
        "His voice was gentle, refined, and unhurried, which only fueled Yu Chuang’s simmering anger.",
        "After discovering that Yu Ziming had disappeared tonight, the first person that came to Yu Chuang’s mind was the ever-smiling Lu Yiman. The more he thought about it, the more agitated he became.",
        "A loud crash came from the other side, followed by an incredibly cold laugh.",
        "——“Hah! You just wait!” ",
        "He chuckled softly, holding the phone in one hand while retrieving a lighter from his pocket with the other. He lowered his head, and with a “click,” the cigarette was lit. The wind blew, causing the smoke to rise and his small ponytail at the nape of his neck to drift onto his shoulder.",
        "Under the streetlight, his face appeared as pale as smooth jade.",
        "\nYu Chuang: Scoffs! Slams the car door in anger!",
        "Lu Yiman: Lights a cigarette, smiles silently. ",
