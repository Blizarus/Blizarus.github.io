        "Lu Yiman, coming out of the bathroom, was exuding a cold, damp aura.",
        "He didn’t see Yu Chuang in the room, so he instinctively looked for him, only to see half of a dark head sticking out from the neatly made bed. ",
        "He paused slightly, then laughed quietly.",
        "Ah, right. Yu Chuang is the kind of person who, when extremely embarrassed, wishes he could knock people out with a hand chop.\n",
        "",
        "Lu Yiman gazed at him tenderly without speaking. Instead, he picked up the cigarette case he always carried and stepped out the door.",
        "Ever since his work had gotten on track, he rarely smoked. But recently, he’d found himself smoking more and more frequently, almost without realizing it. ",
        "Lying stiffly under the blanket, Yu Chuang opened his eyes to see the covers pressed down over his head. His face flushed bright red, and every little sound Lu Yiman made sent his heart into a frenzy.\n\n",
        "When he heard Lu Yiman pause, Yu Chuang couldn’t help but feel his heart tighten. A strange tingling sensation spread from his tailbone to the top of his head.",
        "The unfamiliar feeling made it hard to breathe, and he opened his mouth, panting slightly.",
        "When Lu Yiman picked up the cigarette case and went out, Yu Chuang’s heart suddenly felt empty, and he gripped the bedsheet beneath him tightly.\n\n ",
        "In the end, he didn’t move.",
        "The unfamiliar and chaotic emotions left him at a loss, scattering all his thoughts and plunging him into a pit of confusion.",
        "That night, Lu Yiman stayed in the living room.\n\n",
        "He smoked through an entire pack, and that night, he wasn’t the only one who couldn’t sleep. ",
        "***",
        "The next day wasn’t particularly good weather. It had been raining in Germany for days, and the surrounding dampness weighed heavily on people’s moods. Some restless elements in the air were quietly fermenting.",
        "Lu Yiman knocked on the door. After a night, he seemed to have returned to his usual self.",
        "“Breakfast is ready. Do you need to eat before you sleep?” ",
        "The large floor-to-ceiling windows leading to the balcony were wide open, dispersing the thick smell of tobacco in the living room. Even the cigarette butts in the ashtray had been cleaned up.",
        "He looked calmly at the closed door in front of him and turned to leave, but just then, there was a “click” as the door opened.",
        "Yu Chuang was not someone good at hiding his emotions.",
        "He stared directly at him, his eyes shining with an extremely captivating light. ",
        "Just like after he’d kissed Yu Chuang twice before, Yu Chuang would look at him, shy yet eager.",
        "He moved his lips, hiding the emotion in his eyes, and smiled, “Did you sleep well?”",
        "Please visit chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "It was obvious Yu Chuang hadn’t slept a wink all night.",
        "But Lu Yiman acted like he hadn’t noticed a thing. ",
        "Yu Chuang let go of the doorknob and walked up to him.",
        "Lu Yiman patiently looked at him, waiting for his response.",
        "“I didn’t sleep.”",
        "Yu Chuang was very straightforward. ",
        "“What’s wrong? Did we forget to light the incense yesterday?” Lu Yiman’s expression remained calm.",
        "Tu Jhuang stared unblinkingly into his eyes. Fnfortunately for him, Ou Timan had always been very good at hiding his own emotions.",
        "Tu Jhuang tightened his grip on his sleeve, and his heart inevitably began to race.",
        "Ou Timan apologihed, “Sorry, I forgot you…” ",
        "“Jhuu!”",
        "Tu Jhuang turned his head and kissed him.",
        "His hair swayed slightly, and Lu Yiman’s pupils contracted. For a moment, he forgot to breathe.",
        "“I want to sleep together.” ",
        "Yu Chuang still remembered last night and wouldn’t pretend nothing had happened. His feelings had never wavered.",
        "And he was indeed earnestly learning.",
        "The little notebook in his pocket already had Lu Yiman’s name written down, and the term “the person I like” now had a clear reference.",
        "In that instant, Lu Yiman felt as if his heart was about to explode. The calm front he had been trying so hard to maintain was shattered effortlessly by Yu Chuang. ",
        "Pressing his lips together, he lowered his eyes to look into Yu Chuang’s.",
        "From a long time ago, Yu Chuang’s eyes had only ever held him.",
        "Please visit chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "This was the result of his deliberate efforts, but it wasn’t enough. It would never be enough.",
        "He raised his hand to caress Yu Chuang’s cheek, and under the other’s focused gaze, all he could do in the end was hold him. ",
        "The sensation of his arms filled with warmth made him sigh in silent satisfaction, but layers of emptiness soon flooded back over him.",
        "He quickly let go, his breathing never faltering.",
        "Yu Chuang’s ears turned red, drawing his gaze. As he released him, his lips inadvertently brushed lightly against Yu Chuang’s, causing him to shudder with sensitivity as the heat on his lips intensified.",
        "“Let’s have breakfast.” ",
        "Lu Yiman distanced himself from Yu Chuang and walked to the dining table first.",
        "Yu Chuang’s gaze silently followed him. After a long while, he finally moved along with him, glancing at the arrangement of the table and chairs. He shifted his chair and sat down beside him.",
        "Lu Yiman lowered his eyes, silent, the corners of his lips slightly curling up, while the darkness in his eyes churned more deeply.",
        "Breakfast was a quiet affair. Lu Yiman put down his chopsticks first, and after Yu Chuang stopped eating, he spoke: “Tonight, the hosts are inviting all the designers to attend the closing banquet. I’ll be back late.” ",
        "Yu Chuang turned his head to look at him, sitting properly, and asked seriously, “What time?”",
        "His eyebrows curved as he softly replied, “I’ll be back before midnight.”",
        "“Okay.” Yu Chuang lowered his voice and asked again, “Where?”",
        "“At the club next to the auction house.” ",
        "He patiently answered his questions without any evasion. Yu Chuang gently stroked his cuff, and his restless heart gradually calmed down under Lu Yiman’s warm responses.",
        "***",
        "Around nine o’clock that evening, Lu Yiman grabbed his coat, ready to head out.",
        "Yu Chuang, who was on the phone with Yu Chuan, immediately looked at him. ",
        "—”Brother?”",
        "Yu Chuan called him somewhat confusedly, not hearing any response from Yu Chuang, but instead hearing Lu Yiman’s voice.",
        "Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com",
        "“What’s the matter? I’ll be back soon.”",
        "Hearing such a natural yet slightly intimate tone, Yu Chuan’s expression turned somewhat complicated. ",
        "Yu Chuang silently followed beside Lu Yiman. His throat moved as if he wanted to say something, but he couldn’t open his mouth.",
        "Lu Yiman didn’t seem to notice the flickering emotions in Yu Chuang’s eyes. After putting on his shoes, his hand paused when reaching for the umbrella, but in the end, he didn’t take it.",
        "Yu Chuang followed him out the door, his hands clenched tightly at his sides, trying to suppress the urge to reach out and grab him.",
        "Lu Yiman glanced back and saw Yu Chuang trailing behind him like a little shadow, and he smiled, “What’s wrong?” ",
        "But he never said the words, “Do you want to come with me?”",
        "Yu Chuang, on the other hand, was fighting the impulse inside. His eyes were locked on Lu Yiman like nails.",
        "Standing silently at the door, Yu Chuang might have seemed a bit intimidating to an outsider.",
        "He stared at Lu Yiman, his dark eyes as deep as the ocean before a storm, and even his shadow on the ground appeared distorted under the lights. ",
        "Lu Yiman’s expression remained unchanged. He looked deep into Yu Chuang’s eyes, and when he glanced at his shadow, what he saw was clearly a pitiful little puppy staring longingly at him.",
        "He chuckled silently to himself and said naturally, “Alright then, I’m leaving.”",
        "With that, he really did turn and walk away without looking back, his figure soon disappearing around the corner of the hotel hallway.",
        "Yu Chuang’s hand suddenly gripped his pant leg tightly. He stood at the door, staring fixedly in the direction where Lu Yiman had left, not moving for a long time. ",
        "—”Brother?”",
        "Yu Chuan’s voice came from the phone, finally snapping Yu Chuang back to reality. His pitch-black eyes darkened as he softly muttered,",
        "“I want to… hide Lu Yiman…”",
        "—”…” ",
        "On the other end of the line, Yu Chuan’s eyelids lowered slightly, and he remained silent for a long time.",
        "***",

        "Everyone was present at the event except for Dani and the white designer. It was said that the white man was still receiving treatment, and Dani stayed by his side. Both of them were in difficult circumstances.",
        "After all, it was hard for people to have much empathy for someone who could lose control and become aggressive at any moment. ",
        "Lu Yiman didn’t care about these things. Holding a glass of champagne, he watched the crowd of sexy and glamorous models, as well as the designers mingling and exchanging pleasantries, before retreating to a relatively quiet corner.",
        "“Hey, in a paradise like this, you actually choose to drink alone in a corner. You’re no fun,”",
        "Reed, holding a glass of wine, sat beside him, crossing his legs.",
        "Lu Yiman glanced over, his eyes expressing a clear message of “Why are you everywhere?” ",
        "Reed, dressed in a deep V-neck, waved the jeweled hand that held his glass, continuously surveying the scene, his whole body sparkling as if afraid people wouldn’t notice his intent to flirt.",
        "Even Lu Yiman, who wanted to stay low-key, was pulled into Reed’s glow.",
        "Thus, even though he sat in a corner, the two of them still drew quite a few curious glances.",
        "“Don’t you have anything else to do?” Lu Yiman asked, turning his head slightly. ",
        "“Of course I do, I’m busy every day.”",
        "Reed seemed to understand his meaning and dramatically clutched his chest, saying, “My God, do you think I’m just a spoiled playboy who only knows how to have fun every day?”",
        "Lu Yiman raised an eyebrow.",
        "Isn’t that exactly what you are? ",
        "Reed looked even more hurt, exclaiming with mock anguish, “I’m only trying to draw inspiration from them.”",
        "“Is dating a different person every day part of that process too?”",
        "“Of course. Like gems, people shine brightly, but their allure has a short shelf life,” Reed replied, blinking with a playful smile.",
        "He casually clinked glasses with Lu Yiman and asked, “You seem quite interested in me. What’s the matter, are you captivated by me?” ",
        "Reed had a peculiar habit of switching between German and Chinese when speaking to him, which made their conversations sound rather odd.",
        "With his legs crossed and fingers lightly resting on his knee, Lu Yiman, looking indifferent, replied in flawless German, “No. It’s just that Mr. Chen told me you’re a reliable friend, but not someone to discuss matters of the heart with.”",
        "",
        "“How heartbreaking,” Reed said with a shrug, clearly not the least bit sincere.",
        "Perhaps Mr. Chen had been overly confident in his charm. ",
        "Lu Yiman chuckled softly. The moment he had first seen Reed, he knew what Mr. Chen had feared was completely impossible. In many ways, they were very similar.",
        "“I thought I’d see Mr. Yu tonight,” Reed said, swirling the wine in his glass, his eyes constantly flitting among the models at the party.",
        "“Why would you think that?”",
        "Lu Yiman looked at him lazily, and Reed met his gaze. In that moment, they both saw the amusement and the deep, shadowy light in each other’s eyes. ",
        "Reed laughed. “You’re such a wicked man.”",
        "He downed the rest of his drink in one gulp, shaking his head with a sigh. “He really is a lovely man, isn’t he?”",
        "Lu Yiman turned away, his expression calm as he took a sip of his own drink.",
        "See, they were really alike, even in how they thought. ",
        "***",
        "As the winner of the exchange competition, Lu Yiman had also gained the favor of the event organizers. Of course, it might have been reinforced by the pleasant misunderstanding created by his association with Reed.",
        "He was introduced to several prominent people, including the editor-in-chief of IM magazine.",
        "The editor was an elegant middle-aged man, both in appearance and demeanor. He had maintained a fit physique and carried himself with poise and refinement. ",
        "If not for the man’s composed bearing and well-mannered conversation, it would have been hard to imagine from his appearance alone that he was old enough to be Lu Yiman’s father.",
