    "description": "Lu Yiman was recommended a book by an advertisement, and the more he read, the more unsettled he felt.\nThe protagonist in the book was ordered by a powerful figure not to meet with anyone else, required to return home on time every day, could only see him, could only have him in his heart, and had to think about him for twenty-five hours a day out of twenty-four.\nThe protagonist felt tormented and longed to return to his “white moonlight.” So, he ran, the other chased, but escape was impossible.\nThe entire story was filled with criticism of the powerful figure’s forced love and the hope that the “white moonlight” would save the protagonist from such misery.\nLu Yiman didn’t do anything, but like a chosen one, a prompt suddenly appeared on his screen asking if he was willing to save the protagonist. After hesitating for a moment, he chose “yes,” and thus, he became the protagonist’s “white moonlight.”\nA long time later, everyone was concerned about whether the protagonist had escaped from the powerful figure’s grasp.\nLu Yiman: “Thank you all, the powerful figure is now with me.”\n*************\nGentle, refined and strategic top × cold, silent, and flawed bottom\nOne-sentence summary: A match made in heaven.\nTheme: The hope in your heart is the lighthouse that lights up your life.\nIt’s about two broken people finding love in each other.\nTheir actions, which can be considered toxic in other relationships, are needs here.\nTheir twisted personalities/deep insecurities complement each other.\nI don’t know how to say more without spoiling it.\nSo, if you are not sensitive to flawed characters, give it a try.\nBecause, even though they are twisted, their love story is sweet.\nNovel Updates",
