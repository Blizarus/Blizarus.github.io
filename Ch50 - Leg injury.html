                    <p>The mist at the foot of the mountain gradually thinned. The visibility slowly expanded as well. Through the mist, as light as gauze, one could see the temporary rescue tents at the mountain’s base. The lit lamps dispelled the dim night. Faint voices and footsteps could also be heard from not far away, invigorating one’s spirits.</p><p>A few rescue team members left first to report information in the largest tent in the center of the site, while the others escorted the rescued individuals from the mountain to the pre-established medical tent. </p><p>It was brightly lit inside the tent. The medical staff, having just received the news, rushed forward and surrounded them.</p><p>Two nurses guided Shen Kong, who was wrapped in a blanket, to one of the beds and skillfully arranged various instruments to check his physical condition.
</p><p>Story translated by Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>As one of the nurses rolled up his wet sleeve to treat the scrapes on his arm, the flap of the medical tent suddenly lifted. A few people, bringing with them the damp and cold mist, entered from outside. Shen Kong immediately saw Han Li, who was walking behind the rescue team leader.</p><p>Han Li’s expression was cold and somber, his dark eyes blending into the night behind him. His bloodless, pale fingers clutched a long cane. His suit was impeccably neat, with the mountain dew still clinging to his hair. </p><p>Almost in the next second, Han Li shifted his gaze and looked over, his eyes meeting Shen Kong’s over the shoulder of the nurse bending down to treat Shen Kong’s wound.

</p><p>The expression on Han Li’s face softened slightly. He walked towards Shen Kong with his cane.</p><p>The tip of the cane made a deep sound as it struck the hard ground, a noise that stood out even in the bustling and noisy tent.</p><p>Shen Kong’s eyes moved slightly and sharply noticed something amiss.

 </p><p>Although Han Li’s expression remained calm and composed, as if he had everything under control, his steps were much slower than usual, with his entire weight on one leg. The fingers gripping the top of the cane were turning pale from the force. These small details made Shen Kong frown slightly, instantly realizing——</p><p>Han Li’s leg injury had flared up.</p><p>Although he tried to appear calm, those subconscious actions and changes in his balance didn’t fool Shen Kong’s eyes.

</p><p>Considering the cold, damp environment of the mountain and the eerie foggy weather, not to mention that it was late at night, it would be surprising if his already severely injured knee didn’t act up. </p><p>Shen Kong’s brow furrowed even tighter.</p><p>How did this kid become more reckless with age?</p><p>While he was pondering this, Han Li arrived at his bedside.</p><p>Shen Kong quickly adjusted his emotions and employed the acting skills he had honed over time. A look of surprise and confusion intertwined on his pale face as he hurriedly stood up: </p><p>“President Han? What are you doing here?”</p><p>Han Li’s gaze naturally fell on Shen Kong.</p><p>The blanket wrapped around the young man’s back fell onto the bed with his hasty movement. His half-dry clothes, dampened by the mist, clung to his thin shoulders. His messy hair was wet and sticking to his face. His cheeks were pale from the cold. He seemed to have lost some weight, too. The exposed, rolled-up sleeves revealed scraped arms with still-bleeding wounds, making him look rather disheveled.</p><p>Low could this be called unscathed? </p><p>Lan Oi frowned imperceptibly, but his ezpression remained indifferent and cold. Le answered in a deep voice, “I had some official business to handle in Jity S, so I came by to check on things.”</p><p>Who would believe that?</p><p>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>Shen Kong didn’t ezpose him but instead showed even more poy on his face. “What a coincidence! I was planning to thank you in person after coming down the mountain, but I didn’t ezpect to meet you right here—please, have a seat!”</p><p>As he spoke, he hurriedly stepped forward and, without giving Han Li a chance to refuse, pulled him to sit by the bed. </p><p>Shen Kong used a subtle force. Since Han Li’s leg injury made him unsteady, he was caught off guard and sat down.</p><p>As the distance between them quickly closed, the young man’s warmth immediately transferred over.</p><p>Han Li, feeling a bit uncomfortable, moved aside slightly.</p><p>For some reason, despite the other being trapped in the cold mountain for days with clothes soaked by the mist, his body radiated an intense heat. This vigorous warmth came through the hand placed on Han Li’s shoulder, almost scorching him. </p><p>Although his knee still ached, the pain lessened a bit since it was no longer bearing weight.</p><p>A faint scent of damp earth and fresh grass wafted over. With his heart moved, Han Li turned to look at Shen Kong sitting beside him.</p><p>Before Han Li could say anything, the nurse, who had just given Shen Kong a full-body checkup, approached with a form in her hand. She quickly glanced at Shen Kong and then said:</p><p>“Hello, Mr. Meng, your health checkup is complete. Apart from some malnutrition, there are no major issues. If you’re still concerned, you can get a more thorough examination at a professional hospital.” </p><p>Shen Kong nodded, his eyes slightly curved in a smile. “Okay, thank you very much.”</p><p>Han Li looked up at the nurse and naturally continued the conversation:</p><p>“So, he can leave now, correct?”</p><p>“That’s right.” </p><p>With that, the nurse turned and hurried away. The medical tent remained chaotic. Countless medical staff carried trays of instruments and bustled about, attending to the other rescued individuals.</p><p>Han Li lightly rubbed his cane and turned to Shen Kong:</p><p>“Let’s go. The driver is already waiting outside. I’ve also had someone prepare a change of clothes for you.”</p><p>Shen Kong nodded, obedient and well-behaved like an ordinary kept celebrity. </p><p>Han Li glanced down at his watch, noting that it was past midnight. He leaned on his cane and stood up from the bed.</p><p>But just as he stood up, a pain from the cold seeping into his bones, like thousands of ants biting and crawling, struck him. The intense pain from his weight pressing on his knee hit suddenly, causing Han Li to stumble and uncontrollably fall to the side.</p><p>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>Shen Kong quickly reached out and supported him.</p><p>Han Li grabbed Shen Kong’s arm awkwardly and struggled to maintain his balance. </p><p>Through the semi-damp fabric, the other’s body heat transferred instantly, like a furnace igniting the surrounding air. The sudden spread of warmth enveloped him. The abruptly shortened distance also made Han Li instinctively want to pull away. However, the young man’s strong arm held him in place. They remained in this awkward and ambiguous position for a while before Shen Kong let go, as if nothing had happened, and asked with concern:</p><p>“President Han, are you okay?”</p><p>Han Li stared into Shen Kong’s clear and sincere eyes for a few seconds before slowly straightening up and regaining his composure:</p><p>“Thank you.” </p><p>He lightly brushed off his wrinkled sleeve and then, as if remembering something, said, “By the way, there’s no need to be so formal in the future.”</p><p>Shen Kong paused. The memory of his phone conversations with Han Li flooded back. He hesitated for a few seconds, then tentatively uttered:</p><p>“…Dear President Han?”</p><p>Han Li: “……” </p><p>After a few seconds of silence, he slowly said, “…Just call me by my name.”</p><p>With that, Han Li leaned on his cane and walked forward. From behind, his tall and upright figure inexplicably appeared somewhat disheveled. Shen Kong stood still for a few seconds before quickening his pace to catch up.</p><p>The driver was already waiting at the entrance. After picking them up, they drove towards the hotel where Han Li was staying.</p><p>There wasn’t much light in the mountain night. The city’s light pollution seemed to have been purified here and left no trace to be seen. Only the occasional faint light flickered in the distant forest, quickly left behind by the moving vehicle. </p><p>The crescent moon overhead followed them like shadows. No matter how fast the car went, its silvery light streamed into the windows. It would occasionally be dimmed by tall trees, making the car’s interior alternate between bright and dark.</p><p>Shen Kong turned to look at Han Li sitting next to him.</p><p>The contours of his face were occasionally illuminated by the moonlight outside the window, but his eyes were hidden in the deep shadows under his brow. He seemed to merge with the cold darkness of the mountain, as if no emotion could break through his indifferent exterior.</p><p>His features still retained the shadows of his childhood. </p><p>Shen Kong felt momentarily dazed, as if through Han Li’s eyes, he could see two faces at once.</p><p>One face was deeply hidden in the darkness of the backseat, with a pair of tear-filled black eyes staring at him through the rearview mirror, the stark contrast of black and white filled with heart-wrenching pain and despair.</p><p>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>The other face was obscured by a downpour, with equally black eyes piercing through the heavy rain, carrying a sharp and cold intensity that suddenly stabbed at him.</p><p>Since the age of thirteen, Shen Kong has spent nearly twenty years as a mercenary. He left his mark from mountains and deserts to frozen tundras. From the desolate countryside to bustling cities. Yet his connection with the worldly realm remained distant and indifferent, always just out of reach. He could share life and death in a trench with someone, only to unhesitatingly turn his gun on them on the next mission. </p><p>The relationships he built with anyone were always so shallow. A life of blood and fire, lead and steel, blurred his understanding of the concept of “human.”</p><p>Shen Kong could indulge in fighting, sex, and other excesses, but his rational mind remained coldly detached.</p><p>He seemed like a beast in human skin, an empty shell with nothing inside.</p><p>If you count carefully, he had never interacted with anyone purely without either killing intent or lust. Han Li was an exception, the first of his kind. </p><p>When Shen Kong was forcibly inserted into Han Li’s life by some beyond-normal entity, Han Li was also unexpectedly integrated into the system Shen Kong had built over the past twenty years.</p><p>This feeling was so unfamiliar that it almost made him uncomfortable.</p><p>——But there was no possibility of distancing himself.</p><p>Shen Kong discreetly withdrew his gaze and rested his forehead against the cold car window. Weariness quickly crept through his tired body. </p><p>This body, which had never undergone much training, had reached its limit.</p><p>In the past few days, he has never rested. Even when others were on watch, he remained fully alert and monitored the movements in the fog.</p><p>Now, the suppressed fatigue surged like a tide, pulling him into a deep, dark sea of exhaustion.</p>
