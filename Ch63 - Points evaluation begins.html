                    <p>Han Li’s heart tightened as an overwhelming sense of fear surged from an unknown source and suddenly overwhelmed his psychological defenses.</p><p>He reached out toward the other person in a panic, as if desperately trying to grasp something. But before his fingertips could touch the other’s collar, the young man standing in front of him seemed to suddenly lose all strength and collapse to the ground. </p><p>Han Li stood there in a daze, his pale fingertips frozen in mid-air, as if time had stopped and his breath had ceased.</p><p>The people around him, already shocked by the rapidly changing situation, stood dumbfounded. They didn’t know what to do and just froze in place.
</p><p>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>It was as if everything had stagnated in this enclosed space. In the deathly still study, the sound of the air moving could almost be heard.</p><p>At that moment, the young man on the ground suddenly moved and slowly propped himself up. He looked around in shock and confusion and showed a blank expression. “Where is this…?” </p><p>Han Li stared at the unfamiliar expression of Meng Mingxuan in front of him. His emotions slowly cooled down. It was as if the tumultuous waves on the sea’s surface had suddenly returned to calm. The momentary loss of composure was deeply hidden in his eyes, sinking into a bottomless abyss. His fingers, which had been suspended in the air, tightened one by one before he restrained himself and placed them back by his side.

</p><p>He no longer glanced at the fallen Meng Mingxuan.</p><p>The soul he loved had already left the body before him. The man was now nothing but an empty shell to him.</p><p>Han Li gestured to Lin Ziyu, his voice indifferent:

 </p><p>“Take him away.”</p><p>Lin Ziyu was still reeling from the earlier shock. He stood in a daze for a moment before understanding Han Li’s order. Several men behind him cautiously approached the fallen Meng Mingxuan. They had just seen this seemingly frail young man take down four of their brothers in less than ten seconds. However, to their surprise, despite his panicked struggles, shouts, and even kicks and punches, Meng Mingxuan showed none of his previous strength or skill. Out of respect and fear for Han Li, they dared not use excessive force, yet they easily escorted Meng Mingxuan out of the study.</p><p>After the commotion, the study fell silent once more.

</p><p>Lin Ziyu’s gaze swept over Han Zhuang, Bian Xianjing, and Han Zizhuo, who were huddled fearfully in a corner, like frost-bitten eggplants. They were terrified, cowering and shrunken, nothing like their previous arrogant selves. Watching them, a trace of disdain flashed in Lin Ziyu’s eyes. </p><p>He took a step forward and cautiously spoke:</p><p>“Um… Han-ge, what are you planning to do with those three?”</p><p>Han Li glanced coldly at the three not far away, then indifferently withdrew his gaze, as if they were insignificant ants on the road and not even worth his attention. He said, “Submit the evidence we have to the relevant authorities. Let their cases be handled first. Murder, kidnapping, commercial fraud—those charges are enough to keep them in prison for the next six months.”</p><p>Lin Ziyu lowered his eyes to hide the shock within them. </p><p>Le knew how long Lan Oi had planned and prepared for today’s revenge. To be honest, he didn’t agree with Lan Oi personally killing these three. Although they deserved to die, it wasn’t worth dirtying his hands for them. Landling the bodies, covering up tracks, or silencing witnesses could easily leave traces and weaknesses that could be ezploited. Le had tried to persuade Lan Oi several times, both openly and subtly, but Lan Oi wouldn’t listen.</p><p>His hatred was so intense and deep that he required the sight of his enemies’ blood for release.</p><p>But… what Lin Ziyu didn’t expect was…</p><p>Someone truly managed to pull him back from the brink of extremity and even prompted him to resolve the issue in the most rational way. </p><p>It was simply a miracle.</p><p>Lin Ziyu nodded in acknowledgment and signaled to the men behind him. Several subordinates in black suits escorted the utterly despairing Han Zhuang, as well as the weeping, collapsed Bian Xianjing and Han Zizhuo away. Then, after obtaining Han Li’s permission to handle the evidence and subsequent matters, Lin Ziyu followed them out.</p><p>Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>The luxurious study was left empty.</p><p>Only Han Li remained, standing alone in the center of the room. </p><p>His back was straight. His face was silent as he held a black cane in his pale hand, like a king gripping his scepter.</p><p>“One.”</p><p>As soon as the emotionless mechanical voice fell, Shen Kong felt darkness descend.</p><p>A dizzying sensation accompanied by sharp, tearing pain surged over him like a tidal wave, as if a file were slicing through his nerves inch by inch. </p><p>It seemed as if endless darkness and pain were compressed into a few short seconds, yet also stretched out to the end of time.</p><p>When he regained his senses, he found himself standing in a completely white space without a trace of color. The vast, boundless space extended endlessly into the distance. The almost blinding whiteness made Shen Kong squint slightly. It took him a while to finally adapt to the glaring and monotonous pallor.</p><p>Shen Kong looked down at his hands.</p><p>His fingers were long and strong, covered with fine old scars on both the palms and backs of his hands. Some scars had faded to the point of being almost invisible, while others remained deep and stark. His fingertips were rough, while his knuckles bore thick calluses from years of gripping a gun. These bones and muscles were so familiar, like a well-worn weapon perfectly suited to his hand. </p><p>This was his own original body.</p><p>He was even wearing the same clothes he had worn before coming here.</p><p>Shen Kong wasn’t too surprised. He raised an eyebrow and let his hand hang by his side.</p><p>At that moment, he heard a voice suddenly echoing in the vast, boundless space. The voice was neither male nor female, making it impossible to determine its gender or origin: “Welcome, Rectifier 0893. It has been detected that you submitted an inquiry to the studio. The studio has responded. Would you like to receive the information transmission?” </p><p>——He didn’t expect this.</p><p>It turned out that the ‘rectifier assistant’ actually submitted his question to headquarters. They also agreed to reply.</p><p>He squinted slightly and said:</p><p>“Receive.” </p><p>The moment he spoke, his voice seemed to travel a great distance, echoing in the empty, white space and startling Shen Kong himself.</p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, Shen Kong felt a familiar pain in his head. It was as if an ice pick was being driven straight into the depths of his brain, bringing with it waves of intense pain. Immediately following this, a massive amount of information flooded into his mind. It was an overwhelming stream that was too vast to process instantly, causing him to feel dizzy. He instinctively staggered, but quickly steadied himself. He gradually regained his composure in this chaotic sea of information.</p><p>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>Shen Kong began to digest and understand the information that had been crammed into his head. A trace of shock flickered in his eyes.</p><p>His suspicion was partially correct. </p><p>But it didn’t entirely match reality.</p><p>As initially described, the Three Views Rectifying Studio was a high-dimensional, cross-dimensional studio.</p><p>However, it was not the only one. In addition to it, there were other studios like the Role-Playing Studio, Scum-Busting Studio, and many others belonging to the same entertainment company. These studios trained participants and sent them into small worlds created based on novels, using them as vessels and mediums to undertake various tasks and experience different lives, all to satisfy the curiosity of high-dimensional residents. Evaluations and rewards were then given based on their performance.</p><p>But gradually, the novel dimensions, which were originally submissive to high-dimensional control, began to develop independently. </p><p>Anything not mentioned in the original text was rapidly self-improving. It ultimately formed a complete worldview and started to reject the entry of high-dimensional residents. The studios, unable to intervene directly, couldn’t ascertain what was happening within these small worlds. They had to select characters from sub-dimensions of other novel worlds and use them as mediums to investigate.</p><p>Shen Kong was one of those selected.</p><p>He, like Han Li, was also a character from a book.</p><p>It was just that they belonged to different novels. </p><p>The common setting in their respective worlds was derived from the high-dimensional realm, while the unique species, terrains, and landscapes were results of each dimension’s self-improvement and development.</p><p>At that moment, a giant screen suddenly lit up in the endless white space before him, extending infinitely into the distance. The screen was filled with numerous smaller screens, each displaying entirely different scenes. A multitude of words flashed rapidly across the screen, making it dizzying to follow. Shen Kong could only catch a few pieces of information that flashed past him:</p><p>Bai**ing: “???? After the celebrations, believe it or not, I cried for you, okay? But trust me, my Kong-ge is so awesome, the follow-up will be sweet.”</p><p>Su**Juan: “No way, my chestnut is too pitiful, twenty years, it’s heartbreaking. Kong-ge, come back soon.” </p><p>You**Mo: “Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh, can he come back? Is Kongkong feeling emotional? Is their sweet time next?”</p><p>Several floating cameras slowly appeared around him, each aimed at Shen Kong standing there.</p><p>It seemed… like a live broadcast.</p><p>Shen Kong searched through the information that had been forcibly fed into his mind. It turned out that, to ensure the company could profit from sending sub-dimensional characters into sub-dimensions, the entire task process was being live-streamed for a fee, excluding scenes involving personal privacy. It was like… some kind of reality show. </p><p>At that moment, the emotionless mechanical voice spoke:</p><p>“Points evaluation begins.”</p><p>Chrysanthemum Garden.</p>
