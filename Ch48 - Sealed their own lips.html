                    <p>Twenty-five hours have passed since the production team was trapped.</p><p>This incident has rapidly ignited a wave of public opinion across various sectors, growing ever more intense with time. From social media to mainstream media, an overwhelming flood of reports has emerged. These range from scientific articles and speculations related to the incident, to analyses of rescue strategies and routes, and even to risk assessments of the production team’s predicament. The vast flow of information surging across the internet has continuously pushed the event’s prominence to new heights. </p><p>All the trapped celebrities have garnered immense attention, with countless wishes and blessings flooding their Weibo comments. Even the previously reviled Meng Mingxuan has seen the malicious and sarcastic remarks under his posts overshadowed by rational well-wishers. However, the production team’s Weibo hasn’t been as fortunate. Fans of the trapped celebrities have swarmed it, vehemently questioning the team’s major failures in risk assessment and glaring security lapses. The immense public pressure has forced the production team to issue several apologies and statements, pledging to mobilize all possible resources to search for all participants and thoroughly investigate the negligence of relevant personnel.</p><p>This media frenzy has placed tremendous pressure on the rescue teams.
</p><p>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>However, the massive barrier before them is not something that can be overcome in a day or two. The inefficiency of purely manpower-based searches is extremely difficult to overcome. Despite Han Li’s substantial support in terms of manpower and resources, which has more than doubled their search area within the same estimated time, the unsearched areas still occupy 80% of the map.</p><p>The danger level of being trapped in a mist-covered primeval forest increases exponentially with time. Every second that passes without a rescue brings the trapped individuals one step closer to death. All the workers are exhausting their efforts and racing against time to fight death. </p><p>In the luxury suite on the top floor of the hotel.

</p><p>Han Li sat alone at the table, holding a cigarette between his fingers that seemed long untouched. A wisp of pale blue smoke spiraled upward from the cigarette’s tip. The unsteady ash hung in mid-air, with a small, glowing ember slowly burning upward.</p><p>Several company documents were stacked on the table. An open folder lay in front of him. Obscure terms and complex data blurred into a shadowy mass in the dim light. A large map, folded and placed in the corner, was covered with countless marks and annotations along its blank edges. The slightly crumpled corners indicated it had been consulted more often than expected.</p><p>Han Li lowered his eyes and glanced casually at the open folder in front of him, flipping through it without much interest.

 </p><p>The issues in City E weren’t that serious.</p><p>It was just that several top executives in a few branches made consecutive wrong decisions and disrupted his initial follow-up development plan. When they saw Han Li personally fly in from headquarters to handle the situation, they were on high alert and dealt with it with the utmost diligence. In just half a day, they put the company back on track.</p><p>Han Li flicked the cigarette ash. The light gray embers fell from his fingers into the ashtray.

</p><p>He didn’t smoke often. </p><p>But he frequently lit a cigarette and held it between his fingers, just to watch it burn quietly.</p><p>——The cigarette reminded him of that person.</p><p>He didn’t know the person’s name, appearance, past, or future.</p><p>Han Li didn’t know how to refer to him, so he had to use the term “that person”——He couldn’t deny that the reason he came to City E in person and lingered long after handling the company affairs was because he held a glimmer of hope in his heart. He hoped that Meng Mingxuan would be the person he was looking for. However, all the spies and investigations he deployed clearly showed that Meng Mingxuan had never undergone any significant personality changes. Everyone around Meng Mingxuan also confirmed that they had never noticed anything strange or out of the ordinary about him. </p><p>However… that faint sense of strange familiarity kept pushing him from one extreme to the other.</p><p>It was this tiny spark of hope ignited in the completely hopeless dark abyss that was the most tormenting, making him feel as if he were constantly being roasted between doubt and anticipation.</p><p>Lan Oi frowned irritably and eztinguished the cigarette pust before it burned his fingertips.</p><p>The crumpled cigarette butt was tossed into the ashtray filled with ashes, poining the others there. </p><p>At that moment, the phone on the table suddenly rang.</p><p>Han Li answered the call. The voice on the other end was faint and intermittent due to signal interference, but the news conveyed made Han Li’s eyes light up—they had found some of the production team members.</p><p>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>He suppressed his fluctuating emotions and asked in his usual calm tone:</p><p>“Which ones were rescued?” </p><p>Captain Liu’s voice, though tired, could not hide his joy: “If President Han needs it, I can send you the list right away. We really appreciate your support and assistance this time. Without it, we wouldn’t have been able to rescue the trapped individuals so quickly…”</p><p>Han Li didn’t hear any of the enthusiastic words that followed.</p><p>…No.</p><p>Meng Mingxuan was not among them. </p><p>However, the names of the two wilderness survival instructors were on the list, which could only mean that the production team members had been scattered. Meng Mingxuan’s group had no professionals among them.</p><p>Han Li’s expression slowly grew colder, with a hint of a dark and ominous glint in his deep eyes.</p><p>He put his phone in his pocket, grabbed his suit jacket from behind him, and stood up.</p><p>A sudden sharp pain in his knee caused him to stumble slightly. </p><p>Without showing any obvious discomfort, Han Li frowned subtly and reached for the cane leaning against the table, slowly straightening himself up.</p><p>City E, located near the mountains and shrouded in the eerie fog of the Yunwu Mountain range, was engulfed in heavy, damp air, causing his leg to ache uncontrollably——This old injury had been tormenting him for over a decade, and now it was worse than ever.</p><p>He took out his phone and called Zhao Yun, asking him to bring the car around.</p><p>“Okay, President Han. Where to?” </p><p>“To the rescue tent at the foot of the mountain.” Han Li paused, then added, “…to express sympathy and solicitude.”</p><p>The mountain streams rushed between the rocks, creating an endless sound of flowing water, which seemed particularly clear and loud in the silent fog.</p><p>After hearing this sound for almost two days straight, no matter how pleasant it might be, it inevitably started to annoy everyone.</p><p>The group struggled to move forward in the near-zero-visibility fog and followed the river along the shallow banks. The passage of time had become very blurred. They could only determine when to rest and when to move based on the changing shades of the fog. </p><p>Shen Kong, who walked at the front, spoke very little. He rarely communicated with his teammates unless necessary. Even then, it was usually in short commands.</p><p>Such as “go” or “stop.”</p><p>Story translated by Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>His facial expressions were equally minimal. His face was cold and indifferent, as if only the surrounding milky white fog could catch his eye.</p><p>To the others, the intimidating presence of this unfamiliar Meng Mingxuan was far more daunting than being trapped in the mountains. </p><p>He seemed to exude a sense of distance, with a voice and gaze carrying a cold, metallic quality. The aura of bloodshed and violence emanating from him made everyone shudder. The danger posed by the wild beasts in the mountains couldn’t compare. Even the usually thick-skinned Zhuang Xiangyang didn’t dare to initiate conversation with him.</p><p>Their attitude towards Meng Mingxuan quickly evolved from initial amazement and curiosity to awe and fear.</p><p>No one dared to ask him any questions. Even when his gaze swept over them, they couldn’t help but hold their breath. Only when Shen Kong left to stand guard or hunt before resting at night did everyone finally take a deep breath and relax. His image in their minds became increasingly mysterious. Some thought he might be a government agent on a mission, others speculated he could be an undercover mafia boss, and then there was Zhuang Xiangyang’s outlandish transmigration theory—which everyone dismissed with disdain.</p><p>Zhuang Xiangyang felt very wronged. </p><p>Of course, regardless of the conclusions they reached, everyone unanimously agreed on one point:</p><p>——Meng Mingxuan must have a reason for his disguise, and none of them wanted to be silenced by being too nosy.</p><p>So, absolutely nothing should be revealed!</p><p>Without Shen Kong even realizing it or needing to use any “special means,” his witnesses had already sealed their own lips, almost ready to swear an oath before him. </p><p>As they continued their journey, the river’s flow gradually slowed down. The massive boulders that had obstructed the river disappeared, replaced by smaller stones and gentle riverbanks. The path underfoot became increasingly smooth. Instances of stumbling over the complex terrain grew fewer. The loud, crashing sound of the water also quieted, flowing slowly and calmly through the mist.</p><p>Shen Kong suddenly stopped and made a silencing gesture.</p><p>Everyone behind him froze. They obediently stopped and quietly clustered together like chickens, afraid to disrupt the boss’s judgment.</p><p>Shen Kong squinted his eyes slightly, listening intently to the sounds within the fog. </p><p>After a while, the group also heard the noise not far away.</p><p>——It sounded like… footsteps…?</p><p>They paused in confusion, and soon, the heavy mist ahead revealed vague silhouettes. As the footsteps drew closer, the figures became clearer, until they could finally make out the uniforms and the large characters on their chests:</p><p>Search and Rescue Team. </p><p>A sudden sense of relief washed over everyone. They couldn’t help but feel their hearts lighten. Smiles appeared on their faces as they quickened their pace forward.</p><p>The next second——</p><p>Story translated by Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>Meng Mingxuan’s previously indifferent and almost cold expression changed abruptly. His delicate features crumpled. His amber cat eyes were filled with mist, as if he had endured immense despair and torment. Upon being rescued, he finally allowed his emotions to break free and vented all his grievances:</p><p>“You, why did you take so long to get here! Waaaaaaaaahhhh!” </p><p>Ran Wan: “……”</p><p>Zhuang Xiangyang: “……”</p><p>Cameramen: “……”</p><p>——Damn, that was impressive. </p>
