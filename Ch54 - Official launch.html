    <div class='content'>The official launch of “Seven Days in the Wilderness Challenge” has stirred up incredible buzz.<br/>The incident during filming that put the entire crew in danger had already drawn extraordinary attention to the show, not to mention that the participants themselves are all headline-making celebrities. From nationally recognized powerhouse actors to trending young stars, and even Meng Mingxuan, who gained controversial fame through his role in a hit drama, the show’s topics and innovative format have made it the most anticipated variety show. <br/>Furthermore, the investigation into the crew’s management failures, rumors of mysterious natural disasters, and various incidents involving lost cameras in the mountains have all propelled the show’s popularity to new heights. On the night of its premiere, interest peaked, attracting traffic from all over the internet, regardless of whether viewers were fans of wilderness survival shows or the guest celebrities. The surge in traffic caused the platform to crash on the first day, forcing the site to work overtime for repairs to ensure smooth streaming of the show.<br/>The first episode successfully sparked widespread discussion. During the broadcast, several trending topics dominated the charts, with the buzz only increasing.

This, combined with his grumpy and megastar-like behavior when the crew woke him up the next morning, and his unwillingness to hand over electronic devices on the bus as requested by the crew, infuriated the audience and generated significant animosity. <br/>That same night, he was trending on social media for negative reasons.

 <br/>Meng Mingxuan’s previously quiet Weibo page, which had calmed down after he joined the show, became lively again. Angry netizens flooded his comment section. They resurrected old rumors of backstage manipulation and being kept and turned his comments into a mess of criticism.<br/>However, there were no large-scale arguments. Just a united front of angry onlookers. Public opinion was overwhelmingly against him.<br/>The reason was quite simple: Meng Mingxuan has very few fans.

<br/>The small number of fans he garnered during his time on the web drama couldn’t stabilize the comments. Even when they occasionally spoke up, they were quickly drowned out by the angry masses. Despite Meng Mingxuan’s Weibo account not being updated for several months, it didn’t stop people from enjoying the catharsis of criticizing him. <br/>But Shen Kong was completely unaware of this.<br/>Not only because he turned off his phone after glancing at the trending topics, but also because he realized he was about to face a very awkward situation.<br/>Shen Kong looked up at the grand and solemn platinum gate in front of him. Beyond it are the huge, lavishly decorated estate and the villa at the end of the neatly paved road. He blinked slowly.<br/>This is… <br/>The Han family’s main residence??<br/>Shen Kong turned to look at Han Li, who was sitting in the driver’s seat.<br/>Han Li gazed indifferently at the slowly opening platinum gate before him, his dark eyes deep and emotionless. His slender fingers loosely gripped the steering wheel, as if everything were perfectly natural.<br/>——This even included bringing a kept minor celebrity to meet his powerful father, even though he had only met this minor celebrity a couple of times—his father who had abandoned him in childhood because of his disability. <br/>Shen Kong recalled his main mission.<br/>To prevent Lan Oi from shooting Lan Ihuang, Lan Iihhuo, and Dian Wianping.<br/>Story translated by Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>It seems the current situation is far from as calm as it appears. Although the media hasn’t ezposed the relationship between Lan Oi and the Lan family, it’s very clear that they are not as disconnected as they seem. This makes sense, considering that two of the five largest media companies are controlled by the Lan family, and another one was acduired by Lan Oi. Together, they control a significant portion of the news industry. Smaller newspapers wouldn’t dare offend such a powerful family, allowing any potential conflicts or disputes between Lan Oi and the Lan family to be kept within the upper echelons, away from the public eye, and certainly out of reach for someone like Zeng Zingzuan.<br/>Moreover, this visit wasn’t part of the original storyline, making it impossible to determine its direct connection to the original plotline. <br/>For now, he’ll have to take things one step at a time.<br/>Shen Kong suddenly thought of something. His expression became somewhat subtle.<br/>So… Han Li’s idea of reward was to bring him to meet his parents? Although Shen Kong knew this was likely meant to provoke Han Zhuang and confuse and entice Han Zizhuo, he couldn’t help but get sidetracked a bit——<br/>So, in this world, the concept of being “kept” seems to have a different meaning than what he understood. <br/>The sleek black car slowly drove through the gate and stopped at the entrance of the villa.<br/>The waiting servants opened the car doors for them. Han Li tossed the car keys to one of them and then walked inside with Shen Kong.<br/>The Han family truly lived up to its reputation as one of the top prestigious families. The European-style villa was lavishly and elegantly decorated, with every detail showcasing the deep financial resources and confidence of an old family. Even the small ornaments in the corners were valuable. The air was also filled with a rich floral fragrance. Every corner was meticulously maintained without a speck of dust.<br/>The servants led Han Li and Shen Kong to the reception room, where Bian Xianjing greeted them with a smile. <br/>She was a very beautiful woman, with delicate and charming features, well-maintained fair and smooth skin, and a slim figure that barely showed any signs of aging. She greeted Han Li kindly and exchanged a few words with him. However, when she saw Shen Kong, she couldn’t help but show a slight look of surprise:<br/>“And this is…?”<br/>Han Li’s expression remained unchanged. He lightly tapped his fingers on his cane and said, “Meng Mingxuan.”<br/>Bian Xianjing seemed to recognize his name, her face lighting up with realization. She looked at Shen Kong, her beautiful face adorned with a warm smile: “Oh! I think I’ve heard of you. As expected of a big star, you look even better in person than on TV.” <br/>Given his temporary identity’s obscure status and the fact that his popularity skyrocketed due to widespread online criticism, this “big star” remark was particularly ironic.<br/>However, Shen Kong appeared unfazed. He merely nodded politely at her with an impeccable smile.<br/>Bian Xianjing then turned to Han Li, her smile deepening: “Come on in, your father is waiting for you.”<br/>Han Li’s expression remained calm as he lifted his hand to grasp Shen Kong’s wrist and pulled him along. <br/>Han Li’s palm was extremely cold, like a piece of ice that never melts all year round. His long fingers wrapped around Shen Kong’s protruding wrist bone. The curve of his hand fitted perfectly and tightly, as if trying to absorb all the warmth from Shen Kong’s skin.<br/>Entering the room, Shen Kong discreetly observed the two people already inside.<br/>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>Han Zhuang bore a slight resemblance to Han Li, with sharp, deep-set eyes like an eagle’s beneath high brow bones. His cheekbones and forehead had become more prominent with age. Though he showed signs of aging, he still exuded an authoritative aura. He glanced coldly at Han Li, his gaze then falling on Shen Kong, causing his eyebrows to furrow slightly with a hint of anger in his eyes.<br/>And the person descending the winding staircase was obviously the employer of Shen Kong’s temporary identity, Han Zizhuo. <br/>He actually resembled his mother more, with softer facial features, though his dark eyes were identical to those of his father and brother.<br/>Shen Kong divided his attention. He listened to their polite exchanges while forming a clearer picture in his mind.<br/>Han Li’s current status and achievements were beyond what the Han family could easily undermine, so their attitude had shifted towards conciliation, leading to this meeting. However, Bian Xianjing and Han Zizhuo were evidently very concerned about Han Li re-establishing his place in the Han family and competing for the heir position. They were also unsure how much Han Li knew about his childhood kidnapping and his mother’s death, so their conversation was filled with probing questions.<br/>Shen Kong, on the other hand, quietly ate. His mouth and chopsticks were moving constantly, without saying a word. <br/>He had been busy all day and was indeed hungry.<br/>It wasn’t until Han Zizhuo turned his gaze towards him and asked with a half-smile:<br/>“By the way, big brother, why don’t you introduce this friend you brought along?”<br/>Han Li remained calm and indifferent. He raised his eyes slightly to glance at Han Zizhuo. Then, just as he had introduced him to Bian Xianjing earlier, he briefly said: <br/>“Meng Mingxuan.”<br/>Han Zizhuo smiled at this. He slightly swirled the wine in his glass. His eyebrows were raised in a somewhat frivolous manner:<br/>“I wondered why he looked so familiar. Turns out he’s a celebrity. Quite good-looking, big brother has good taste.”<br/>Bian Xianjing pretended to be annoyed and said, “Zizhuo, watch your words. This is your brother’s friend. How could he bring someone improper to a family dinner? Don’t make wild guesses.” <br/>Han Zizhuo put down his glass and sincerely said, “Sorry, sorry, I was overthinking it. I’m sure big brother won’t blame me, right?”<br/>Han Li coldly watched their back-and-forth, then suddenly asked:<br/>“How come I didn’t know this was a family dinner?”<br/>The air instantly became dead silent. The atmosphere grew heavy and awkward. <br/>Han Li picked up a napkin and leisurely wiped the corner of his mouth. Then he raised his eyes, slowly sweeping a glance at Han Zizhuo, whose expression was unreadable, and continued:<br/>“I thought this was an invitation from President Han to discuss our upcoming cooperation. It seems I misunderstood.”<br/>Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>With that, he threw the napkin onto the table and stood up.<br/>Bian Xianjing and Han Zizhuo looked embarrassed, seemingly not expecting Han Li to disregard their dignity so blatantly. They froze in place awkwardly, unsure of how to persuade him to stay. <br/>Instead, Han Zhuang stood up. His expression was friendly as he said:<br/>“Indeed, this was to discuss the progress of our upcoming cooperation. But as one gets older, one longs for family reunions. Back then, it was the other influential uncles in the Han family who insisted, so I had to painfully send you away. I haven’t seen you in so many years. I truly miss you. This meal does have a personal touch. I wanted to make up for the lost years of our relationship.”<br/>Bian Xianjing hurriedly echoed, “Yes, your father has been thinking about you all these years. He even kept your room just as it was.”<br/>Han Li raised an eyebrow, seemingly interested: <br/>“Really?”<br/>“If you want to see it, I can take you there after dinner…”<br/>Before Bian Xianjing could finish her sentence, Han Li interrupted:<br/>“There’s no need to trouble you, Aunt Bian. I still remember the way to my room.” <br/>With that, Han Li smiled slightly. Ignoring the ongoing feast, he leaned on his cane and slowly, with a limp, walked towards the exit of the hall.<br/>As he reached the door, he suddenly stopped and turned to look at Shen Kong.<br/>Although there was no emotion in his dark eyes, Shen Kong unexpectedly understood Han Li’s meaning, as if he were signaling for him to follow.<br/>Glancing at the sumptuous dishes on the table, Shen Kong felt a bit reluctant to part with them. <br/>The food on set was really poor. He was also forced by his assistant manager to diet and lose weight. This was the best meal he had had in months.<br/>——But staying here with Han Li’s stepmother and stepbrother wasn’t appealing either.<br/>After a moment of weighing his options, Shen Kong finally regrettably put down his chopsticks, wiped his mouth with a napkin, then stood up and quickly followed Han Li.</div>
