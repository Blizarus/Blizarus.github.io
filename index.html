                <p class="mb-1">Lu Yiman was recommended a book by an advertisement, and the more he read, the more unsettled he felt. The protagonist in the book was ordered by a powerful figure not to meet with anyone else, required to return home on time every day, could only see him, could only have him in his heart, and had to think about him for twenty-five hours a day out of twenty-four. The protagonist felt tormented and longed to return to his “white moonlight.” So, he ran, the other chased, but escape was impossible. The entire story was filled with criticism of the powerful figure’s forced love and the hope that the “white moonlight” would save the protagonist from such misery. Lu Yiman didn’t do anything, but like a chosen one, a prompt suddenly appeared on his screen asking if he was willing to save the protagonist. After hesitating for a moment, he chose “yes,” and thus, he became the protagonist’s “white moonlight.” A long time later, everyone was concerned about whether the protagonist had escaped from the powerful figure’s grasp. Lu Yiman: “Thank you all, the powerful figure is now with me.” ************* Gentle, refined and strategic top × cold, silent, and flawed bottom One-sentence summary: A match made in heaven. Theme: The hope in your heart is the lighthouse that lights up your life.</p>
