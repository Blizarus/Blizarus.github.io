                    <p>Content warning: mentions of dark and gory themes. Proceed with caution.</p><p>It was pitch black and gloomy outside the window. The desolate and uninhabited mountain path seemed even more rugged at night, causing the enclosed body of the car to shake with difficulty while driving. </p><p>In the railroad car, several bored kidnappers were making rude and vulgar jokes, bragging in a foreign language about how many people they had killed, how many prostitutes they had fucked, how many innocent victims they had tortured and killed, and how many they had cruelly cut off body tissues while still alive for the first time, just for fun.</p><p>Shen Kong crossed his arms and leaned on the back of the chair, lowered his eyes tiredly, and yawned for the fifteenth time tonight.
</p><p>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>Suddenly, the car jerked and stopped.</p><p>The man in the driver’s seat cursed bitterly and tried to restart the ignition, but due to his rough and urgent actions, the car only made a few weak squeaks and then shut down completely. </p><p>The kidnapper sitting in the back row opened his mouth to ask: “What’s wrong?”

</p><p>“Damn it, this car won’t start.”</p><p>The man spat, turned his head somewhat impatiently, and asked, “How far is it from the agreed place?”</p><p>The person behind replied: “It’s not that far, still a few kilometers away.”

 </p><p>The kidnapper irritably pounded the steering wheel hard to vent his anger. He was silent for a while, then opened the car door and got out of the car: “Then let’s just stay here. We’re all in the wilderness anyway. Whether this kid is dead or not dead, the most we can do is to bury him in a pit. Not that much difference.”</p><p>The two people at the back dragged Han Li, who was still struggling desperately, out of the car. They pushed the child, whose hands and feet were bound, to stagger and crawl with difficulty in the dusty mud.</p><p>One of them picked him up and forced him to half-kneel, while the kidnapper, who was driving before, pulled out a black gun from his waist and slowly pointed it at the child’s bruised and bleeding forehead.

</p><p>Shen Kong also got out of the car and stood beside him with his arms folded, looking on in a lazy manner as if this matter had nothing to do with him. </p><p>Han Li, who was still crying and shouting just now, suddenly became quiet. His black and white eyes were washed by tears, looking particularly dazzling on his young and tender face, stained by mud. He silently gazed at the man who was about to execute him. His gloomy eyes possessed fierceness beyond his age.</p><p>The kidnapper was so intimidated by such a look that his finger on the trigger hesitated for a moment.</p><p>At this moment, thick layers of clouds were blown by the strong wind, blocking the fundamentally not very bright moonlight.</p><p>The small Han Li unexpectedly became violent. He abruptly stood up, knocked away the gun’s muzzle pointing at his forehead, and then rushed desperately towards the dark cliff covered by dry twigs next to the mountain path—— </p><p>According to the plot, he would roll down the cliff, and the kidnappers, who were thinking that he would die for sure, would then leave.</p><p>Three days later, people sent by the Lan family to search found the dying Lan Oi at the bottom of the cliff: his whole body was covered with wounds, and half of his body was disabled.</p><p>But——</p><p>At this moment, Shen Kong, who was standing aside, suddenly raised his hand, grabbed little Han Li by the back of his collar, and forcefully pulled back the child, who was rushing down the cliff. </p><p>Han Li was like a wounded small animal, kicking his legs in vain in mid-air and roaring from his mouth, sealed by tape.</p><p>Pitch-black eyes stared at Shen Kong with hatred, as if ready to charge over and bite his throat the next second he was let go.</p><p>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>Shen Kong lowered his head and raised his eyebrows at him in interest.</p><p>The kidnapper who was knocked away by Han Li stood up straight, his face flushed red as he walked over quickly, shamed into anger: “Fuck it, how dare this little damned brat run away? He’s so damn ungrateful!” </p><p>As he spoke, he stretched out his hand towards Han Li, who was being lifted in mid-air.</p><p>At this moment, he felt his own arm being grabbed.</p><p>The cold palm was like an iron hoop, slowly exerting force weighing more than a thousand kilograms. The severe pain made him scream out in surprise. He shouted in another language: “What the hell are you doing? Let go of me quickly.”</p><p>Shen Kong smiled and winked. He suddenly pulled him towards him and then used his palms to forcefully bend the other person’s arm in the opposite direction—— </p><p>The crisp sound of “crack”—of a bone fracturing—sounded in the dark night.</p><p>The kidnapper’s arm was forcibly broken.</p><p>The situation took a turn for the worse. The man screamed at the top of his lungs. His other free hand quickly reached for his waist, but Shen Kong got the gun one step ahead of him. He took the dumbfounded Han Li to hide him in his arms. Then he swiftly bent his waist in front of the kidnapper and pointed the gun on his shoulder.</p><p>“Bang” “Bang”! </p><p>Two deafening gunshots broke the silence. The two kidnappers, who realized that something was wrong, already fell down before they could even take out their weapons.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, Shen Kong threw away the man whom he regarded as a meat shield, easily resolved the opponent’s dropped weapons because he was weak due to pain, and then ruthlessly kicked him down.</p><p>He weighed the black and heavy piece of metal in his palm and then aimed the muzzle of the gun between the opponent’s eyebrows——</p><p>There was a gunshot, and then the man stopped moving. </p><p>The whole process only took tens of seconds, and it was over before the others could even react.</p><p>Han Li stared blankly, forgetting to struggle. The two, in vain, tear stains on his muddy face appeared quite funny.</p><p>Shen Kong came over and tore off the tape on his mouth.</p><p>The second half of Han Li’s face turned red because of his simple and rough actions. Tears soaked his eyes again, but he did not cry out in pain. He only looked up at Shen Kong and asked in a child’s voice that was already hoarse: </p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Shen Kong didn’t answer but showed him a kind and gentle smile.</p><p>Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>Then he raised his hand and stuck the tape back on again, even bending over to tighten the ropes binding his wrists and ankles.</p><p>Han Li:…… </p><p>Then why did you tear off the tape in the first place???</p><p>Han Li felt a burning sting coming from the lower half of his face, but it was nothing compared to the hurt he suffered from being deceived.</p><p>He glared at the man standing in front of him with double resentment, trying to dismember the kidnapper alive with his eyes.</p><p>He was wrong! He shouldn’t have thought that this person had good intentions! He was just another hateful criminal! </p><p>Shen Kong pulled open the car door and relaxedly threw the tightly bound Han Li into the back seat. Facing the murderous gaze of the future villain, he smoothly turned around and bent over to search for something on the fallen kidnapper.</p><p>Saber, half a box of cigarettes, a clip of bullets, pocket money……</p><p>There was also a forged ID card, but the forgery was so clever that even Shen Kong could hardly see any flaws.</p><p>At this moment, the system suddenly asked: “Just now, why didn’t you act immediately?” </p><p>Shen Kong shrugged indifferently and replied in his mind: “Don’t you think their hopeful expressions shattering into pieces look more interesting?”</p><p>——Whether it was that brat or those outlaws who thought they were sure of victory.</p><p>System: “……”</p><p>Shen Kong kept moving, reaching out to fish out the mobile phone from the man’s coat pocket, and then unlocked the screen with his still-warm fingers from the body. </p><p>This was a disposable phone. All messages were deleted after reading them. There was basically no useful information.</p><p>However, Shen Kong originally didn’t have high expectations. He put the phone back into his pocket and explained casually:</p><p>“Of course……there are other reasons. The way the driver held the gun, the model of the gun, and the Armenian language he spoke all indicate that they should be illegal mercenaries or have interrelated backgrounds. They’re even doing these kinds of dirty jobs, like kidnapping, killing, and dumping corpses. He has no professional ethics at all. He can even put his hand on a child…… In short, in order to prevent accidental injuries, it’s natural for me to find the right time and wait for him to relax his vigilance. ”</p><p>However…… Han Li’s reaction made his eyes light up. </p><p>This kid still has some backbone.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a deafening gunshot from behind.</p><p>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>Shen Kong didn’t have enough time to be shocked. He nimbly rolled on the spot and used the car as a cover to aim at the place where the sound came from.</p><p>However, he only saw the kidnapper, who had been shot down before, swaying. And then he fell on his back again. </p><p>Shen Kong thought something was wrong and quickly ran towards the rear of the railroad car. He opened the door and saw Han Li trembling and curling up, letting out low wails and sobs. Blood swiftly spread on his slender legs, dyeing his cloth a dazzling dark red.</p><p>The bullet passed through the car door and wounded Han Li’s leg.</p><p>For the first time, Shen Kong put away his careless and sloppy expression. His eyes were cold and terrifying, like a thick and heavy dark cloud that was about to press down on his enemies.</p><p>No one knew his marksmanship better than him. It was impossible for that person to get up again. Even if he truly missed, he did not believe that these mercenaries with no moral bottom line would have such a strong sense of responsibility that even if they died, they would still complete their mission. </p><p>Unless……</p><p>At this moment, the system’s mechanical voice sounded in his ears:</p><p>“The world trajectory has detected a deviation and has been automatically rectified.”</p>
