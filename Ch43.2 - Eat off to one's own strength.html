                    <p>The second-to-last person in the group was no longer very safe. Shen Kong tried to quicken his pace to move to the front of the group, but after taking just a couple of steps, his plan was disrupted by Zhuang Xiangyang, who came up beside him.</p><p>Zhuang Xiangyang made his debut through the currently popular boy band audition show. Although he was very popular, he was still very young and approached everything around him with the enthusiasm and curiosity of a youth. He moved next to Shen Kong and said in a mysterious tone: </p><p>“Mingxuan-ge, what you did just now was amazing. How did you do it?”</p><p>The corners of Shen Kong’s mouth twitched. He gave him a sidelong glance before asking in return, “Is there anything you’re afraid of?”
</p><p>Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>Zhuang Xiangyang thought about it seriously, then turned his head to make sure no one else was around before lowering his voice and saying:</p><p>“Um, clowns…” </p><p>Shen Kong raised a gentle smile: “Then just imagine being locked alone in a room full of clowns at midnight. Doesn’t it feel like you could do anything?”

</p><p>Zhuang Xiangyang’s steps suddenly halted, his face turning pale, obviously scared by the image that had popped into his mind.</p><p>Shen Kong’s mood subtly improved. Even his steps became much lighter.</p><p>After walking for two hours through the forest, they finally reached the resting spot arranged by the show crew. It was at the edge where the dense forest met a stream. The lush, carpet-like green grass looked particularly beautiful under the dappled sunlight. The sound of the babbling stream nearby seemed to wash away their physical and mental fatigue. After trekking for several hours, the guests were all extremely tired. With a cheer, they each found a place to sit and rest their feet, and some, more relaxed, sprawled out directly on the grass.

 </p><p>However, they hadn’t rested for long before the instructor cruelly called them to get up.</p><p>“Does everyone still remember the name of our show?”</p><p>“…Seven Days in the Wilderness Challenge…”

</p><p>They answered weakly and sparsely. </p><p>The instructor, still as energetic as before, said, “That’s right! Our goal is to help everyone adapt to surviving in the wilderness, overcome extreme conditions, and eat off to one's own strength for seven days. So, get up quickly! It’s time to gather ingredients for today’s lunch! If you don’t work, you don’t eat!”</p><p>The guests suddenly burst into wailing.</p><p>Lowever, their luggage was prepared by the show crew. No one had the chance to bring any food. So now, their only hope for a meal was to gather it themselves.</p><p>The instructor assigned tasks and sent the guests out in pairs: one group to pick wild vegetables and fruits, one group to collect firewood, and one group to catch fish. </p><p>Shen Kong was assigned to the fishing group because of his “good aim.”</p><p>He and Duan Mingcheng walked toward the river. As they got closer, the sound of rushing water became clearer. After pushing aside the last cluster of trees, the entire river came into view. The rapid water flowed over the rocky riverbed, creating white splashes and foam as it struck the stones. Several large black fish occasionally leaped out of the clear water, their dark scales glistening beautifully in the sunlight.</p><p>Duan Mingcheng, full of enthusiasm, rolled up his sleeves and pant legs, ready to catch fish.</p><p>Shen Kong, determined not to stand in the spotlight this time, merely waved his fishing tool aimlessly in the water, hoping to escape the task by just splashing around. However, despite Duan Mingcheng’s mature and steady appearance, he was quite inexperienced at fishing. His movements in the river were even clumsier than Shen Kong’s. Even the fish that Shen Kong deliberately drove towards Duan Mingcheng’s net managed to escape in his flustered attempts to catch them. After a whole twenty minutes, the two of them caught nothing. </p><p>The smile on Shen Kong’s face remained unchanged, but deep inside, he wanted to roll his eyes in frustration.</p><p>Although he prided himself on being in good shape, he was hungry after holding out since five in the morning!</p><p>Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>He turned his head to glance at the camera’s position, then subtly shifted his body to block one of the cameras directly facing him. He suddenly raised his voice and said:</p><p>“Mingcheng-ge, behind you! A big fish!” </p><p>As Duan Mingcheng frantically turned around to look for the big fish, Shen Kong took the opportunity to flip his wrist and accurately catch a black fish jumping in the rapid water with his net. With practiced speed, he knocked the fish’s head against a rock, stunning it.</p><p>Using the flowing water as cover, he tossed the stunned fish into Duan Mingcheng’s net. The entire series of actions was seamless and took less than twenty seconds.</p><p>Duan Mingcheng felt a weight in his hand and turned to look at the sudden extra fish in his net with surprise.</p><p>Before he could figure out what had happened, he heard Shen Kong exclaiming in delight: </p><p>“Wow! Mingcheng-ge, you caught a fish! Amazing!”</p><p>Duan Mingcheng lifted the net in front of his eyes and shook it with a confused expression: “It seems so… but… why isn’t it moving?”</p><p>When a typical fish is caught in a net, it will struggle desperately and twist its slippery, powerful body in an attempt to leap out. The force is considerable. A fish can easily slip out and escape with the current if not handled carefully. This had happened to Duan Mingcheng twice before, with fish escaping from his net each time. However, the fish in his net now were entirely different. It lay motionless at the bottom of the net, as if it were dead.</p><p>Duan Mingcheng frowned, “Could it be a dead fish?” </p><p>Shen Kong remained silent for a moment, then calmly explained, “Impossible. I just saw it jumping out of the water lively. It’s probably too scared of people and got shocked. I think it might have been stunned by hitting a rock due to the current.”</p><p>Just as he finished speaking, the fish in Duan Mingcheng’s net finally seemed to wake up and give a twitch of its tail.</p><p>Duan Mingcheng accepted this explanation, a happy smile spreading across his face. “Then I must be really lucky!”</p><p>Shen Kong repeated his trick a few more times. Within ten minutes, Duan Mingcheng had caught three more “stunned” fish. He hefted his now heavy net, smiling from ear to ear. </p><p>“I think our luck has turned around this time! These three should be enough for us to eat. Let’s head back and show everyone our catch.”</p><p>Shen Kong smiled and nodded, cooperating by saying,</p><p>“It’s all thanks to you, Mingcheng-ge. Your fish-catching skills are impressive. I didn’t help much at all.”</p><p>Duan Mingcheng shook his head, “No, no, if it weren’t for you helping to drive the fish, we wouldn’t have such a bountiful catch.” </p><p>With a perfect smile on his face, Shen Kong also humbly deflected the praise.</p><p>The two of them returned triumphantly.</p><p>Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>The others who went to collect firewood and pick fruit had already returned. When they saw Shen Kong and Duan Mingcheng and the large fish in their hands, everyone was very delighted and clapped happily.</p><p>Only the instructor hesitated for a couple of seconds when he took the net, asking somewhat confusedly, </p><p>“Why do these fish… look so lifeless?”</p><p>Three fish of varying sizes lay at the bottom of the net, their mouths opening and closing repeatedly. Their tails occasionally moved weakly as well, looking very feeble.</p><p>Duan Mingcheng proudly replied:</p><p>“These are all fish stunned by the current. Our luck this time is exceptionally good!” </p><p>Instructor: “???”</p><p>Is that even possible?</p><p>Shen Kong, who was walking behind Duan Mingcheng, kept a straight face as he turned his head to look at the sky, the ground, and the air. Then, without drawing attention, he hid his hand, which still had fish scales from knocking out the fish, behind his back.</p><p>The author has something to say: </p><p>Shen Kong: Once the deed is done, I brush off my clothes and leave quietly, hiding my meritorious service and fame.</p>
