                    <p>Han Li ascended the stairs, his cane tapping rhythmically against the smooth marble floor.</p><p>The pitch-black suit fit snugly over his broad shoulders and straight back, the fabric undulating with his movements and gleaming under the lights. </p><p>He gazed at the corridor, which was so similar yet different from his memories. His dark eyes betrayed no clear emotion.</p><p>After skillfully turning a corner, Han Li stopped in front of a closed door.

Besides simple furniture, it was devoid of decoration, with straight, indifferent lines. It was devoid of any warmth, making it hard to believe it was a child’s room.

</p><p>Shen Kong followed Han Li inside and looked around before frowning:</p><p>“…This is the room you lived in as a child?”</p><p>Han Li didn’t answer immediately. He slowly walked to the bedside, picked up a photo frame, and after gazing at it for a moment, he replied:

 </p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Shen Kong walked around the room twice.</p><p>As he passed by Han Li, his gaze instinctively swept over the photo in Han Li’s hand.

</p><p>In the simple black frame was an old-looking photo of a fair-skinned woman with gentle eyes and a dignified, noble appearance. She was smiling at the camera. Her features bore some resemblance to Han Li’s. </p><p>Shen Kong’s steps halted.</p><p>Han Li removed the photo frame and gently took out the photo.</p><p>Noticing Shen Kong’s gaze, he said calmly, “This is my mother. She passed away when I was eight.”</p><p>Shen Kong sharply noticed Han Li’s fingertip gently brushing the surface of the photo, a barely perceptible movement. </p><p>Feeling a slight stir in his heart, a sorry expression appeared on his face, “…I’m sorry.”</p><p>Han Li pocketed the photo and then looked at Shen Kong. His dark eyes shone under the light, seemingly holding back some indescribable emotion, or perhaps nothing at all. “There’s nothing to be sorry about.”</p><p>Shen Kong recalled that one of the main catalysts driving Han Li to turn his gun on those three people in the plot was his discovery that his mother’s death was not an accident, but a murder.</p><p>His heart sank slightly. He instinctively grabbed Han Li’s arm just as he was about to walk past him. </p><p>Han Li stopped and looked at him with some confusion.</p><p>Realizing the impropriety of his behavior, Shen Kong slowly released his grip and smiled half-embarrassedly:</p><p>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>“Sorry… I couldn’t help myself. Actually, my mother also passed away when I was very young, so I can really empathize…”</p><p>He lifted his eyes to meet Han Li’s and spoke half-truthfully: </p><p>“I pust wanted to say, don’t be too hard on yourself—this isn’t your fault.”</p><p>After speaking, Shen Kong took a small step back and fearfully withdrew his hand. Le pressed his lips together in shame and restraint. “Sorry, I overstepped.”</p><p>Lan Oi glanced down at the spot where Shen Kong had grabbed him, his voice restrained:</p><p>“…It’s fine.” </p><p>The room’s light was turned off. The two walked out, one after the other. The corridor’s air, illuminated by the light, was quietly filled with a rich fragrance. It was as if everything had fallen silent, with only the sound of footsteps echoing on the ground.</p><p>Shen Kong gazed at Han Li’s back and suddenly asked:</p><p>“Um… President Han, can I ask you a question?”</p><p>He still used Meng Mingxuan’s tone, his soft voice tinged with slight confusion. </p><p>Han Li’s steps faltered slightly, but he didn’t turn his head. Shen Kong could only hear his voice drifting from ahead:</p><p>“Go ahead.”</p><p>“Why did you decide to keep me in the first place?”</p><p>After saying this, he seemed to realize the ambiguity of his words and hurriedly explained, “I, I didn’t mean anything else, it’s just, with your status, you shouldn’t lack people who like you. Besides… all this time, you don’t seem to…” </p><p>The young man’s voice took on a hint of embarrassment:</p><p>“You don’t seem to have any interest in me…”</p><p>He didn’t continue, but the implication was very clear.</p><p>Han Li suddenly stopped. If Shen Kong hadn’t halted in time, he would have collided with Han Li’s back. </p><p>The next second, Han Li turned around, his expression tight and blank. However, the previously restrained and indifferent facade seemed to crack deeply, as if the forced calmness and detachment had completely failed. His deep, dark eyes seemed to burn with a hidden cold flame. He stared intensely at Shen Kong with a gaze filled with a mix of complex emotions. They were of similar height. The close proximity almost allowed their breaths to intermingle, filling the air with a thick, ambiguous tension.</p><p>Han Li lowered his gaze, his eyes lingering on Shen Kong’s lips. He seemed about to lean in, but then forcibly restrained himself halfway.</p><p>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>It was as if he was using his rationality to resist an indescribable attraction, like someone teetering on the edge of an abyss, pulled by a deadly gravity, only to be stopped by a strong survival instinct at the last second.</p><p>He finally gritted out a single, thin word through clenched teeth: </p><p>“You…”</p><p>The next second, Han Li took a deep breath and stepped back, reining in the emotions that had suddenly leaked out and returning them to his cold, indifferent facade. He averted his gaze, his voice hard: “…Don’t speculate about my thoughts.”</p><p>With that, he turned and walked down the stairs.</p><p>Watching Han Li’s back, the emotions belonging to Meng Mingxuan faded from Shen Kong’s face, revealing his true expression—cold, rational, indifferent, as merciless as a blade, with a beastly, sinister air… Yet, there was a hint of complexity and confusion in his eyes that softened his cold, weapon-like aura. </p><p>He curled his fingers and pressed them against his lower lip, momentarily puzzled.</p><p>For a moment, he almost thought… Han Li was going to kiss him.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Wait… Could it be… </p><p>Shen Kong was startled. The previously dismissed suspicion suddenly resurfaced clearly in his mind.</p><p>——No way!!</p><p>Back at the table, Han Li very clearly adopted a sociable attitude and expression. With his cooperation and Han Zhuang’s deliberate friendliness, Bian Xianjing and Han Zizhuo seemed to have received a warning and no longer made barbed comments. Surprisingly, the banquet was very successful and ended with everyone in high spirits.</p><p>Not only did they discuss the next steps of their cooperation at the table, but Han Zhuang even saw Han Li to the door, eager to arrange another meeting and ignoring Bian Xianjing’s slightly twisted smile out of sight. </p><p>Han Li drank quite a bit.</p><p>Having learned his lesson from the last incident, Shen Kong didn’t touch a drop. So, he took on the role of the driver and drove Han Li back to his residence.</p><p>He drove the vehicle along the nighttime road, his gaze shifting through the rearview mirror to the back seat where Han Li sat.</p><p>Han Li looked quite sober, seemingly unaffected by the alcohol. His face appeared even paler after drinking. He resembled a lifeless marble sculpture under the passing lights outside the window. He had his eyes half-closed, lost in thought. </p><p>Shen Kong composed his scattered thoughts, turned his gaze back to the road ahead, and focused intently on driving.</p><p>Over forty minutes later, he finally arrived at the address Han Li had given him.</p><p>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>Shen Kong drove into a private underground garage, parked the car, and then looked into the rearview mirror at Han Li.</p><p>“President Han, you’re home.” </p><p>There was nothing but silence inside the car.</p><p>Han Li remained in the same position, sitting quietly and motionless in the darkness.</p><p>Shen Kong leaned over from the driver’s seat and, upon getting closer, realized that Han Li had fallen asleep at some point.</p><p>He raised his voice and called Han Li’s name twice before Han Li finally opened his eyes slowly and stared quietly at Shen Kong. His usually cold, dark eyes now rippled with the effects of alcohol. He looked somewhat dazed under the cold garage light. </p><p>Han Li looked at him for a long time before finally speaking. His voice was slightly raspy with a hint of nasal tone as he uttered a simple monosyllable:</p><p>“…Hmm?”</p><p>…He actually didn’t seem very sober.</p><p>Shen Kong got out of the car, opened the rear door, and quickly caught Han Li as he slumped out of the door. </p><p>He resignedly helped Han Li out of the car and struggled to close the door with the tip of his shoe.</p><p>Though Han Li appeared lean, his bones and muscles were solid, like a bag of unconscious cement weighing heavily on Shen Kong’s shoulder. This caused him to stagger due to his lack of exercise from spending too much time on set.</p><p>Shen Kong took a deep breath and hoisted Han Li’s arm higher. For a moment, he missed the days when he was light enough to lift with one hand.</p><p>Half-carrying and half-dragging Han Li to the elevator door, Shen Kong realized that access to the underground garage required a key. With no other choice, he supported Han Li with one hand while searching his body with the other. </p><p>In their thin summer clothing, their bodies were tightly pressed together. Han Li’s slightly cool body temperature seemed to have a hint of tipsy warmth. As Shen Kong’s hand groped for the pocket, inevitably brushing against some sensitive areas, Han Li let out a faint gasp. Even Shen Kong, thick-skinned as he was, couldn’t help but feel a bit embarrassed.</p><p>Just then, the elevator suddenly dinged open.</p><p>An elderly man with graying hair, dressed in a pitch-black uniform, stood inside the spacious elevator. His serious expression cracked slightly as he looked at the two entangled people in front of him: “…Excuse me.”</p><p>With that, he shakily reached out to press the elevator close button. </p><p>Shen Kong quickly extended a foot and blocked the elevator door from closing.</p><p>He tried to ignore the awkward position he and Han Li were in and focused on Uncle Xu, who, despite appearing much older than he remembered, still looked robust and energetic. Shen Kong forced a stiff smile: “No, no, you misunderstood. President Han is drunk, I’m just bringing him home.”</p><p>Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>Uncle Xu promptly reopened the elevator and helped Shen Kong move Han Li inside while saying:</p><p>“I saw the young master’s car enter the garage, but he hadn’t come up for a long time, so I came down to check.” </p><p>He looked at Han Li and frowned: “I’ve never seen the young master this drunk.”</p><p>Uncle Xu turned to look at Shen Kong and asked, “Who did the young master… dine with today?”</p><p>Shen Kong supported Han Li’s slender waist with one hand and dragged him into the elevator. He replied as they moved: “It should be… with his father and other family members, I think…”</p><p>Uncle Xu sighed and instantly understood why Han Li was so out of sorts. He seemed to age ten years in a moment and shook his head: </p><p>“Anyway, I’m sorry for troubling you.”</p><p>Shen Kong shook his head. “It’s no problem. Since you’re here, I can leave with peace of mind…”</p><p>As he spoke, he reached to pull Han Li’s arm from around his neck and tried to detach him.</p><p>He pulled once, but it didn’t budge. </p><p>Shen Kong’s expression stiffened. He pulled harder a second time—still no movement.</p><p>Just as he was about to pull a third time, he suddenly stopped.</p><p>Shen Kong slowly raised his head and looked at Uncle Xu, who stood by with an inexplicable expression and a strange look in his eyes. Under Uncle Xu’s intense gaze, Shen Kong’s face slowly broke into a perfect smile. He straightened up:</p><p>“Never mind, I’ll take President Han upstairs myself.” </p>
