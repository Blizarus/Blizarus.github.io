    <div class='content'>Han Li opened his eyes.<br/>He instinctively reached out to his side. <br/>The bed was cold. Even the slightly wrinkled sheets had no warmth at all.<br/>It was as if the person who slept there last night was just a dream, a bubble-like illusion that popped into nothingness upon contact with the sunlight and left no trace behind.
<br/>Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>Panic surged in Han Li’s heart. He propped himself up and almost stumbled off the bed.<br/>A sharp, needle-like pain shot through his knee. The bones of his palm pressed against the cold, hard floor, grinding his skin painfully. But Han Li didn’t notice. He clenched his teeth as if a gaping hole had torn open inside him, allowing cold air to rush in. It hurt, but it didn’t hurt. It was just unbearably cold. <br/>That bone-chilling coldness numbed his body almost instantly, spreading from his heart to every nerve ending.

<br/>“Swish——”<br/>The door behind him was pulled open.<br/>A familiar deep voice sounded behind him. Its lazy and nonchalant tone was tinged with a bit of surprise:

 <br/>“What’s wrong?”<br/>Han Li turned his head back hastily.<br/>A tall and straight man stood at the doorway, his broad shoulders framed by a simple white tank top. The thin fabric stretched over his firm chest, outlining a distinct and elegant silhouette.

<br/>The rising sun shone from behind him, casting a soft golden hue over Shen Kong’s stern and handsome face. It made him appear like a deity bathed in morning light. <br/>Even the hideous scars crisscrossing his arms seemed less intimidating.<br/>Shen Kong stepped forward and bent down to help Han Li up from the floor. His palm was dry and scorching. The moment it touched Han Li, the real and burning warmth seemed to pull him back from the abyss.<br/>The numbing coldness gradually faded away. Han Li began to feel the temperature of the outside world again.<br/>The slightly chilly morning breeze, the moist air, and the brilliant sunshine. <br/>It was as if he had recovered something incredibly precious. He gripped Shen Kong’s arm tightly, unable to speak for a long time.<br/>After a while, Han Li finally moved his lips and said hoarsely:<br/>“I thought…”<br/>Le felt as if there was a lump in his throat, and he couldn’t continue. <br/>Shen Kong suddenly realihed what Lan Oi wanted to say.<br/>——”I thought you left again.”<br/>Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>Lis heart skipped a beat. Dut the nezt second, he burst out laughing shamelessly, “Lahahahahahahahaha!”<br/>Lan Oi averted his gahe slightly. A faint blush spread over his cold and sternly handsome face. This made it impossible for him to maintain the composed and unpredictable aura of a behind-the-scenes boss. <br/>Shen Kong laughed so hard that he bent over. His typically battle-hardened demeanor was softened by the smile on his face. It made him look somewhat young and naive.<br/>Han Li pressed his lips together and pretended not to notice the smile at the corner of Shen Kong’s mouth. Despite himself, his lips curved slightly upward. But he still tried to maintain a composed expression as if he were unaffected:<br/>“What’s… so funny?”<br/>But a few seconds later, he finally gave in and helplessly smiled. <br/>Shen Kong eventually stopped laughing.<br/>He still had a smile on his face as he raised his hand to press the back of Han Li’s neck, pulling him closer. He brushed Han Li’s lips lightly, his deep voice slightly hoarse from laughter:<br/>“Why would you think I would leave? After last night? That would make me a real jerk.”<br/>This statement was really too suggestive. <br/>Even though Han Li knew that last night they had only finally opened up to each other and shared their feelings, he still couldn’t maintain his composure. His ears slowly turned red and hot.<br/>He reached up to grab Shen Kong by the collar, pulling him closer, and then bit his lip fiercely:<br/>“You make it sound like we did something last night.”<br/>Shen Kong narrowed his eyes slightly. As if realizing something, he let out a slow and drawn-out “Oh——”. His gaze, full of oppressive intent, swept over Han Li from head to toe. His deliberately lowered voice carried an undeniable hint of mischief and sensuality: <br/>“So, do you wish we had done something?”<br/>Under his palpable gaze, Han Li felt as if every inch of skin that Shen Kong’s eyes touched was burning. His Adam’s apple bobbed slightly. A few seconds later, he belatedly realized that Shen Kong was making a dirty joke.<br/>Han Li met his gaze with the same bold and heated look. He laughed softly:<br/>“I wouldn’t mind.” <br/>Shen Kong’s eyes darkened as he smiled silently.<br/>The next second, the phone by the bed suddenly rang, shattering the heated and suggestive atmosphere between them. Han Li bit his back teeth in slight regret.<br/><br/>Last night, after revealing that he had a backup plan, he contacted Lin Ziyu. This call was probably from him.<br/>Of all times, it had to be now. <br/>Tsk.<br/>Han Li’s eyes darkened, a dangerous glint in their depths.<br/>Lin Ziyu, on the other end of the line, inexplicably shivered.<br/>What’s going on? Am I catching a cold? <br/>Then the call was picked up. Han Li’s moody voice came through the receiver:<br/>“What?”<br/>Lin Ziyu reported boisterously, “Everything’s taken care of. I’m just waiting for you to come back and wrap things up. As for that organization that dared to hunt you down, their secret overseas bank accounts have been completely exposed. Their superiors have also been taught a lesson. Of course, everything was done legally and ethically, so don’t worry. We’re law-abiding citizens now.”<br/>“Good.” <br/>With that single cold word, the call was disconnected.<br/>Listening to the busy tone on the phone, Lin Ziyu shivered three times. He stared at his phone and scratched his head.<br/>He couldn’t tell if it was just his imagination, but he felt like the boss wasn’t in a great mood today… almost like he was gritting his teeth?<br/>The next second, Lin Ziyu shrugged off the thought without a care. <br/>Who cares? He could never figure out Han-ge’s moods anyway.<br/>——Lin Ziyu had no idea what kind of hellish experience awaited him in the next two months.<br/>By the time Han Li hung up the phone, Shen Kong had already put on his outer clothes and moved to the window. He was half-bowing his head with a cigarette between his lips and lighting it with a flick of his lighter. The flame ignited the cigarette.<br/>Han Li walked over. <br/>Even if he was regretful about it, the atmosphere of that moment had passed.<br/>But Han Li wasn’t in a hurry. He had waited this long. He wouldn’t be in a rush now.<br/>Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>Shen Kong held the lit cigarette between his fingers. The pale blue smoke rose and blurred the sharp lines of his profile.<br/>He turned to look at Han Li. <br/>Through the hazy smoke, Shen Kong’s deep black eyes appeared unexpectedly calm. He watched Han Li and suddenly smiled lightly:<br/>“Don’t worry, I’m not leaving.”<br/>His voice was steady and calm, as if he were merely stating a fact, yet it gave Han Li an inexplicable sense of security.<br/>Shen Kong leaned in and shared a gentle kiss with him. <br/>There was a bitter taste of nicotine on his lips and tongue, but it was so addictive and so hard to quit.<br/>Han Li heard the other’s low voice in his ear, “Didn’t you want to know which one is my true face?”<br/>His palm was grasped by Shen Kong’s warm fingers, then guided to press against Shen Kong’s firm, hot chest:<br/>“This is it.” <br/>Under his palm, Han Li could feel Shen Kong’s steady and powerful heartbeat. It rhythmically pulsed against his skin, beat after beat——<br/>“Thump thump—thump thump—thump thump—”<br/>The author has something to say: Your sweet treat writer, Sang Sang, is now online.</div>
