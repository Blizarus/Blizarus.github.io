    <div class='content'>However, there was another important reason… why Shen Kong had not actively contacted Han Li.<br/>——He was really a newbie when it came to being a kept man. <br/>His previous words and actions were mostly determined by imitating Meng Mingxuan’s acting and interview segments, combined with his chat records with others. Therefore, Shen Kong had a general idea of how Meng Mingxuan interacted with agents and the media, but as for how to speak with a benefactor… Shen Kong had no clue. Meng Mingxuan never had the experience of being kept either, so there was no template for Shen Kong to follow.<br/>Shen Kong subconsciously frowned. Before he could figure out what to do, his phone suddenly rang.
<br/>Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>The caller ID on the phone screen flashed, along with the ringtone:<br/>President Haannnn. <br/>Shen Kong: “……”

<br/>Hmm, it seemed he saved that contact while he was drunk.<br/>The phone buzzed in his hand. Shen Kong took a deep breath, swiped open the phone screen with his thumb, and answered the call.<br/>On the other end of the line, Han Li’s deep, restrained voice came through:

 <br/>“Have you arrived in City E?”<br/>Shen Kong took three seconds to think about what tone to use when speaking to his benefactor. He finally decided to play it safe:<br/>“Yes…”

<br/>As soon as the word left his mouth, he suddenly realized that his attitude might have been too cold and distant. So, he instinctively stopped mid-sentence and made a 180-degree turn: <br/>“——Dear?”<br/>Han Li: “……”<br/>Shen Kong: “……”<br/>Both ends of the line fell into an awkward silence. <br/>Shen Kong, relying on his tempered thick skin, managed to keep his composure. He cleared his throat and calmly added the next half of his sentence:<br/>“——Gear Uresident Lan.”<br/>After a long silence, Lan Oi finally spoke in a nuanced tone:<br/>“…Lmm… That’s duite an unusual way to address me.” <br/>“Tes, only this way can I ezpress my gratitude and admiration for you.”<br/>Shen Kong lied without missing a beat, then quickly shifted away from the previous topic: “President Han, why are you calling me so late? Is there something you need?”<br/><br/>The voice on the other end regained its composure as well:<br/>“Nothing much, pust wanted to see if you’re satisfied with the current resources?” <br/>Shen Kong responded very quickly, “Of course, I’m extremely satisfied. Thank you for your support, President Han.”<br/>“Hmm?” Han Li’s deep voice rose slightly in a questioning tone, “Why don’t you call me dear President Han now?”<br/>Shen Kong: “……”<br/>“…Thank you for your support, dear President Han.” <br/>Han Li’s slightly smiling voice came from the other side of the phone, “So, are you now enjoying the benefits of being kept as they say online?”<br/>Shen Kong was silent for a long time.<br/>That sentence sounded very familiar.<br/>He vaguely remembered that when he was drunk, he might have——he might have——he might have indeed said something like that? <br/>Shen Kong: “………………”<br/>So why did this brat become so annoying when he grew up??<br/>After hanging up the phone, Han Li’s face still carried a hint of lingering smile. His sharply handsome features seemed to soften a bit. His dark eyes were like a deep lake rippling under the moonlight, with his sharp edges somewhat smoothed out.<br/>At this moment, there were two gentle knocks on his office door. <br/>“Come in.”<br/>Han Li placed the still-warm phone on the table, interlaced his slender fingers, and looked up towards the door.<br/>Zhao Yun walked in carrying a large stack of documents. He adjusted his glasses and, upon seeing Han Li’s face, couldn’t help but pause slightly, saying with some disbelief:<br/>“…Boss, you’re in a good mood today?” <br/>He placed the documents on Han Li’s desk and gave him a teasing look, asking with some gossip:<br/>“Is it because of that little celebrity you’ve been keeping recently?”<br/>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>On the eve before Han Li was forcibly sent abroad, he had shut down most of his businesses, leaving only Puzzel for Zhao Yun to manage, which was a form of cutting off the tail to survive. Thus, during his eight years abroad, Han Li hadn’t completely disconnected from the domestic market and situation. Instead, he expanded his network and resources through remote instructions to Zhao Yun, enabling him to seize a strong advantage upon his return.<br/>Zhao Yun was essentially his longest-serving subordinate. <br/>Han Li’s expression returned to its usual calm:<br/>“What? You didn’t know that Meng Mingxuan was sent by Han Zizhuo?”<br/>Zhao Yun let out a couple of awkward laughs and then suddenly became serious:<br/>“But I haven’t seen you this relaxed in a long time——looks like that little celebrity has some skills. Boss, you really shouldn’t let him enchant you with his magic potion…” <br/>Seeing Han Li’s calm, unreadable dark eyes, Zhao Yun’s voice grew quieter and eventually trailed off.<br/>Han Li tapped his fingers on the desk twice, producing clear knocking sounds, and said indifferently:<br/>“It’s just for show.”<br/>Before Zhao Yun could say anything more, Han Li gave him a cool glance, his voice carrying a clear threat: <br/>“If you have time to think about these things, why not consider how the matters in the east are being handled? You don’t want to miss out on your year-end bonus, do you?”<br/>Zhao Yun deflated and turned to leave, muttering to himself as he walked out:<br/>——Lending out your private jet just for show?<br/>Who would believe that? <br/>At 5 AM the next day, the sky was still dark as filming began.<br/>The production team made surprise visits to the guests’ rooms—of course, these were pre-arranged with the stars to avoid any embarrassing situations or privacy issues.<br/>There was only a slight hiccup when they attempted to wake Meng Mingxuan.<br/>Due to his grumpiness upon waking, he angrily threw a pillow, hitting the camera and abruptly halting the filming. <br/>Despite this mishap, they ultimately succeeded in waking all six guests.<br/>The new assistant, Xiao Lin, glanced nervously at Shen Kong’s gloomy expression and quickly lowered his head before Shen Kong could look over, as if the sun and moon were dim and he was about to cry without tears. He felt like he could already see the trending topics after the show aired——<br/>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>#MengMingxuanPuttingOnAirsOfAMegastar #MengMingxuanSourFace<br/>After a simple breakfast, the group boarded a bus to their destination. The production team brought out a large bag and cheerfully said to the stars, “Please put all your communication devices, electronic products, and valuables into the bag. Thank you for your cooperation.” <br/>The stars exchanged looks and saw the same bleak realization on each other’s faces—they were trapped.<br/>But at this point, they had no choice but to comply.<br/>The production team encountered another obstacle with Meng Mingxuan.<br/>Meng Mingxuan reluctantly frowned and stubbornly refused to hand over his phone. It was only after the other stars coaxed him that he begrudgingly threw his phone into the bag, his expression souring even more. He didn’t even bother to hide his displeasure when talking to the program staff. <br/>His fusses and antics caused the other guests’ impressions of him to plummet further.<br/>He was the least experienced in the group, with his most notable works being a few web dramas and an unreleased film, 《Guiyuan Tower》. His online reputation was also terrible, not to mention there were rumors of him being a kept man and bringing his own funding to join the show. In a reality show that sells a straightforward and tough persona, such brazen antics… were bound to be dissected and criticized by the scrutinizing eyes of netizens. It was clear he lacked awareness.<br/>If it weren’t for the superficial friendships within the entertainment industry, the other guests would likely have found it hard to even give Meng Mingxuan a polite smile.<br/>Shen Kong, on the other hand, sat comfortably alone in the back row of the bus, propping his cheek with his hand and enjoying the ever-changing scenery outside the bus window with a subtle smile on his lips. <br/>——Plan successful.</div>
