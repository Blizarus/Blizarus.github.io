                    <p>After helping Han Li settle down, Shen Kong slipped to the outside of the private room where Xu Linsheng held the party and blocked the door knob from the outside to prevent anyone from coming out halfway to cause trouble or see something they shouldn’t see.</p><p>Next, Shen Kong’s actions became much more calm and at ease. </p><p>The positions of the hunter and prey were instantly reversed.</p><p>Like a bird in the forest or a fish in the water, the agile young man seemed to be born for the darkness. He skillfully shuttled through the maze-like corridors, taking advantage of the terrain and his body to blend into the shadows, like a swift shadow or a gust of wind.
</p><p>Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>One after another, the hired thugs, who spread out to look for someone, were suddenly attacked by a shadow coming out of the darkness. All of them lost consciousness before they even had time to groan.</p><p>On the other side—— </p><p>Cheng Zekang walked quickly, searching the corridor for any place where a person could hide while cursing and muttering to himself, his heart full of resentment.

</p><p>Where did that wild brat go? Damn it, he was wasting his time at this moment. He didn’t know what Mr. Wang was doing with this money loser, but it didn’t matter. As long as the money is in place, he will readily take this opportunity to get rid of this burden.</p><p>Suddenly, a strange sense of crisis arose in Cheng Zekang’s heart without warning, as if something was not quite right.</p><p>His pace involuntarily slowed down.

 </p><p>After a while, he finally realized where the feeling of something being wrong was coming from.</p><p>It was too quiet in his ears.</p><p>Although, in order to prevent alarming more people, their movements were as quiet as possible, when walking in the corridor, they could still hear the chaotic footsteps and whispers of others in deliberately lowered voices. But now, nothing could be heard, whether it was footsteps or breathing; it seemed as if they were completely absorbed by some existence beyond what is normal, leaving only the dead silence like a black hole.

</p><p>Cheng Zekang toughened his scalp and took two steps forward. </p><p>In the empty corridor, the only sounds that could be heard were the sound of his own soles tapping the hard ground and the sound of his erratic heartbeat.</p><p>His heart raced with fear, but he summoned his courage and walked in the direction he came from. As he walked, he raised his voice and shouted:</p><p>“Brother Li?”</p><p>“Brother Li, where are you guys?” </p><p>There was still dead silence in his ears. Cheng Zekang panicked. Just as he was about to take out his mobile phone to make a call, he saw a shadow leisurely coming into view at the corner beside him.</p><p>He felt happy and walked forward quickly: “Brother Li, why were you guys so quiet just now? I was scared to death…”</p><p>As soon as he turned around the corner, the smile on Jheng Iekang’s face stiffened.</p><p>Le saw the money loser that they had dug three feet into the ground but could not find, standing in front of him alive. </p><p>Jheng Iekang couldn’t remember the last time he saw him. In his vague and shallow memory, he only had the impression that this wild brat was really a crybaby; whether it was when he was a child or when his slut mother died, his eyes shivered. Lis big, shrunken eyes were always filled with tears, which was really annoying.</p><p>But the young man standing in front of him now, apart from being unfamiliar, brought him more uneasiness.</p><p>Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>He only panicked for a few seconds before he forced himself to calm down and act according to the original plan he had been told before.</p><p>Cheng Zekang’s face sank, and his long, sallow, and wretched face was filled with nondescript anger. He said with that false and artificial attitude of a strict father: “Why are you here?! This is not the place for a child like you! Hurry up. Come with me.” </p><p>As he spoke, he reached out and grabbed the young man’s arm.</p><p>But this grab unexpectedly caught nothing.</p><p>Cheng Zekang’s eyelids twitched, and his sunken eyes revealed real anger. He curled his lips and shrank his cheeks slightly:</p><p>“You fucking dare to dodge…?” </p><p>The rest of his words were blocked in his throat.</p><p>He saw the corners of the young man’s lips in front of him hooked up in a half-smile, his light brown eyes showing an almost animalistic pale yellow hue under the light. He looked down at him from a commanding position, with a chilling sense of dread lurking in the depths of his gaze. He didn’t speak and just calmly scrutinized him, as if appreciating a lifeless object in a shop window.</p><p>Cheng Zekang cowered subconsciously. The anger just now was like a spark doused with water. It only flickered twice before it was extinguished in his heart.</p><p>He composed himself; his eyes were somewhat evasive, but he still scolded bluffingly: “You uncultured, unfilial child dare to show such an attitude to your father. See if I won’t find someone to come and discipline you…” </p><p>Cheng Zekang grumbled and cursed as he took out his cell phone. He seemed calm, but in fact, he was dialing Brother Li’s phone number in a panic.</p><p>Shen Kong didn’t stop him either, looking at him with considerable interest, a slight smile lingering on his lips.</p><p>“Toot… Toot… Toot…”</p><p>Beads of sweat broke out on the tip of Cheng Zekang’s nose, glistening under the light. He raised his sleeves and wiped the sweat from his face, but suddenly, he heard a familiar ringtone ringing close by. </p><p>His eyes lit up. He quickly raised his head and looked in the direction of the sound.</p><p>He saw Shen Kong casually taking out a loudly buzzing mobile phone from his pocket, playing with it casually.</p><p>He raised his eyes to look at the dumbfounded Cheng Zekang, revealing a smile on his face:</p><p>“Who are you calling?” </p><p>The panic on Cheng Zekang’s face could no longer be concealed. He stared dumbstruck at the young man in front of him, with an expression on his face as if he had seen a ghost in broad daylight.</p><p>Shen Kong unhurriedly took two steps closer, threw up the still-ringing phone, caught it, and said:</p><p>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>“If you’re looking for this uncle, don’t bother. He probably can’t hear you now.”</p><p>He paused for a moment, a mysterious smile appearing on the corners of his lips: “But we talked, and he’s quite nice…” </p><p>Cheng Zekang subconsciously backed away as Shen Kong approached. He forced himself to calm down, his shrewd eyes rolling around in the sunken eye sockets. Then he squeezed out a kind and caring smile on his face, his wrinkled and dull long face looking particularly unwell:</p><p>“Dad actually cares about you. Look, at such a young age, you’re frequenting these dubious places. Dad is worried that you’ll pick up bad habits. It wouldn’t be good if you ended up like me back then… It’s not just a moment of impatience. Was I a bit harsh in my words? Xiao Chen, please forgive me. Over these years, Dad has realized his mistakes and wants to make up for them. Can you give Dad a chance?”</p><p>Shen Kong tossed the phone to Cheng Zekang smoothly. Seeing him catch it flusteredly, he said with a smile:</p><p>“Okay.” </p><p>Seemingly not expecting Cheng Chen to agree so simply, Cheng Zekang was also stunned.</p><p>“Let’s start with repaying the money first.” Shen Kong yawned lazily and counted one by one slowly: “We can settle the child support payment, tuition and other miscellaneous fees, and the gambling money you took from home over the years. It adds up to approximately 867,700 yuan… How about this? I’ll round it up for you. Give me 870,000 yuan, and that’ll be enough.”</p><p>Every line on Cheng Zekang’s face seemed to be frozen. His lips trembled, revealing a distorted smile:</p><p>“This… Dad doesn’t have that much money on hand now…” </p><p>Shen Kong narrowed his eyes, his previously careless expression instantly disappearing. He stared at him expressionlessly, his voice flat and indifferent:</p><p>“For richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, you will love each other until death.”</p><p>Wedding…vows?</p><p>Cheng Zekang’s hair stood on end, and an ominous premonition surged in his heart. He opened his mouth tremblingly, but his voice seemed to be stuck in his throat, and he could only make a harsh, raspy sound. </p><p>Shen Kong looked straight into the other person’s eyes and said softly:</p><p>“Mom said she misses you very much.”</p><p>Cheng Zekang’s psychological defense collapsed instantly. The unfamiliar and terrifying son in front of him and his strange and dangerous behavior almost frightened him to death. He pressed his sweat-soaked back tightly against the wall, with his two legs trembling and his whole body exhausted. It took all of his strength to prevent himself from slipping to the ground. He gazed at the young man in front of him with a pale face, unable to say a word.</p><p>Shen Kong suddenly smiled: “I’m just kidding.” </p><p>Cheng Zekang’s face looked deathly pale——the murderous intent in the other person’s eyes just now was real, and he couldn’t believe it was just a joke.</p><p>“After all, you are my only father.”</p><p></p><p>Shen Kong took a few steps closer and whispered in his ear: “So, good dad, can you tell me why they sent you here to find me?”</p><p>Cheng Zekang stammered twice and seemed to want to change the topic, but was frightened by the coldness in Shen Kong’s eyes. He was not a principled person to begin with, so he quickly handed over all the information he knew. He said, “I actually don’t know what happened specifically. It seems to be an order from the boss above. It seems to be related to the boss of this place, but they didn’t tell me the specific connection. They just… just told me to act worried about you and asked me to pull you out of the party without attracting anyone else’s attention, and then, and then…” </p><p>He racked his brains for a moment and suddenly realized: “Yes, I heard them say it seemed to be related to some account book!”</p><p>PUZZEL’s boss? Account book?</p><p>Shen Kong frowned seamlessly and searched through his memories of the past few days, but he was still confused.</p><p>Didn’t he just go to the casino and win a few games? What does it have to do with some account book? </p><p>When did he get involved with PUZZEL’s boss? What does this have to do with anything?</p><p>Just as Shen Kong was contemplating, he keenly sensed a slight change in Cheng Zekang’s gaze in front of him, as if he were looking behind him.</p><p>A sharp cracking sound came through his ears.</p><p>Shen Kong quickly dodged to the side and looked behind him, only to see that the person he had knocked unconscious before was already standing up, wielding a stool and swinging it towards him. </p><p>Before he could fight back, he saw the big fellow holding the stool suddenly sway and then fall face down with a “bang” sound.</p><p>Shen Kong was stunned for a moment. He looked towards where the man was standing just now——only to see Han Li standing not far away, breathing heavily, holding half a pipe in his hand.</p><p>His face was flushed, his pitch-dark eyes were misty, and he could barely stay awake.</p><p>Han Li blinked and loosened his fingers. The pipe fell to the floor with a clang, rolling away with a rumble. </p><p>He raised his eyes and glanced at Shen Kong, staggered two steps forward, and then his whole body uncontrollably fell down.</p>
