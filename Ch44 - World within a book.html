                    <p>After having lunch and resting for a bit, the group set off again.</p><p>Everyone was much more familiar with each other than at the beginning of the show, so they were more comfortable chatting and joking around. Dai Yang, being a comedian and host, kept the conversation lively and humorous along the way, lightening the mood of the whole team. The two female guests couldn’t stop laughing. </p><p>Additionally, the program team randomly assigned various quirky tasks to everyone. Completing these tasks would allow them to exchange for essential supplies from the program team. Although the journey was long and rugged, everyone had a great time. There were no sudden mishaps like in the morning as well. The atmosphere was very relaxed. Even time seemed to pass quickly.</p><p>Shen Kong, however, remained detached throughout.

Every time Shen Kong tried to lower his presence, Ran Wan, whom he had saved in the morning, would seamlessly pull him into conversations and tasks, drawing more attention and camera time to him. Duan Mingcheng, who had partnered with him once, seemed to regard him as a junior worth mentoring and always cooperated with him. Not to mention Zhuang Xiangyang, who had become an instant fan since seeing him throw a knife. Zhuang Xiangyang would seize any opportunity to pester him with questions. The camera would follow them from the moment Zhuang Xiangyang approached. </p><p>Shen Kong: “……”

</p><p>It’s really hard to be invisible.</p><p>Before sunset, the group arrived at the campsite chosen by the production team.</p><p>On an open clearing, six tents lay quietly side by side, not yet set up. The group stared silently at the clearing for a moment, then simultaneously turned their heads to glare at the director. Feeling the weight of their gazes, the director calmly stepped forward, cleared his throat, and announced:

 </p><p>“Now we have a new task for everyone. The guest who sets up their tent first will receive a mysterious reward from the production team.”</p><p>None of the participants had any experience setting up tents, so they could only fumble around based on instinct. Each person was flustered, creating plenty of comedic moments: one moment they were propping up a collapsing tent pole, the next they were pulling on a suddenly snapped rope. They wished they had a couple of extra pairs of arms. The camera captured every detail of their chaotic antics, likely to generate considerable buzz when the episode aired.</p><p>After half an hour, everyone was exhausted and collapsed on the ground, but the tents were still not properly set up. They leaned this way and that, one side sticking up and the other sinking down, looking like six misshapen faces.

</p><p>Shen Kong was equally tired. </p><p>The tent was too easy to control in his hands, making it difficult to appear inexperienced. He even had to deliberately sabotage his own efforts to match the group’s pace, eventually producing a crooked, twisted tent.</p><p>Finally, the instructor stepped in to demonstrate. Only then did everyone manage to set up their tents correctly.</p><p>Since none of them met the standards, not only did no one receive the special reward, but everyone had to face a punishment.</p><p>With a mysterious smile on his face, the instructor revealed the long-prepared secret punishment. </p><p>Oarge leaves were covered with plump, wriggly worms, moving around inside the bowl-shaped foliage. Sach time one climbed to the edge, the instructor would swiftly shake it back down.</p><p>Ran Wan, who was timid, screamed at the sight. Even the men turned pale, cautiously glancing at the worms before quickly looking away in disgust.</p><p>Shen Kong alone silently swallowed.</p><p>Four years ago, during a mission in the jungle, he had eaten these worms for an entire week. In those scarce food conditions, they were a delicacy: rich in protein, juicy, tender, and almost melting in the mouth. Whether raw or cooked, they were delicious. He and three other freelance mercenaries had nearly wiped out the worms within a ten-mile radius before reluctantly moving on to other food sources. </p><p>He never expected to encounter them again here—it must be fate.</p><p>After enjoying the frightened looks from everyone, the instructor finally showed some mercy and informed them that the worms would be divided into three portions: two cooked and one raw. In the next task, the group of guests who finished last would face the punishment of eating the raw worms. Hearing this, everyone forgot about decorum and used all their energy and wits to avoid being last. Shen Kong, however, continued to slack off, maintaining his persona of being useless and troublesome.</p><p></p><p>——For him, it didn’t matter whether the worms were raw or cooked.</p><p>Because they were all delicious. </p><p>The sun slowly set, finally sinking below the horizon. The golden-red of the sunset painted the dense, primordial forest with a beautiful hue, which was gradually replaced by the deepening night. The sky’s color transitioned from a vibrant light blue to a dark, profound blue, as deep and beautiful as spread ink.</p><p>A day of filming had exhausted everyone.</p><p>A campfire crackled in the center of the camp, its flames small and insignificant under the vast sky.</p><p>Shen Kong picked up a dry branch from the ground and threw it into the fire. </p><p>The roaring campfire crackled loudly, its sudden light reflecting on Shen Kong’s face and in his pupils. The flickering flames danced across his sharply defined features, casting alternating shadows and light, making him seem apart from the rest of the world.</p><p>Ran Wan, who was sitting next to him, pulled her cloak tighter around herself. She looked up at the clear night sky and sighed in awe:</p><p>“It’s so beautiful…”</p><p>Shen Kong followed her gaze upward. </p><p>Above them, the vast sky was dotted with countless stars, gently twinkling and forming a magnificent, captivating panorama.</p><p>“Yeah, it really is.”</p><p>“In the city, you can’t see so many stars.”</p><p>The murmurs of the others in his ears seemed to come from a distant place, as distant and indistinct as through a layer of mist. Shen Kong gazed deeply into the vast, boundless night sky before him, slowly narrowing his eyes. The amber in his eyes no longer reflected the dancing firelight, only a deep, cold silence remained. </p><p>It was like a lightless abyss. A quiet, empty well.</p><p>Shen Kong suddenly called out to the system in his mind:</p><p>“System, are you there?”</p><p>The long-silent system sprang to life in his mind, its monotonous mechanical voice sounding in his ear: </p><p>“Yes, do you need anything?”</p><p>Shen Kong lowered his head, his neck slightly sore from looking up for so long. He slowly glanced around at the others sitting by the campfire, his gaze passing over their fire-lit, varied expressions. He then asked in his mind:</p><p>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>“I remember you saying this is a world within a book, right?”</p><p>The system’s response was crisp and without hesitation: “Yes, that’s correct.” </p><p>Shen Kong reached down and grabbed a handful of dirt, gently rubbing it between his fingers. The fine particles fell silently through his fingers, blending into the soil of the night.</p><p>“I remember when I first arrived, you summarized the content of this novel for me. If I’m not mistaken, it’s a clichéd love story set in the entertainment industry, and the protagonists are two men. The entire plot revolves around these two characters and ends when they get together. Isn’t that right?”</p><p>The system’s voice was emotionless: “Yes.”</p><p>Shen Kong’s eyes darkened as he continued to ask: </p><p>“Then how does such a clichéd, dog blood, third-rate love novel manage to construct such a vast world?”</p><p>The system did not respond. Shen Kong had no intention of waiting for its answer either. Instead, he continued speaking to himself:</p><p>“Logically, although Han Li is the most featured antagonist in the story, he is not the protagonist. Yet his entire life, from childhood onward, is meticulously and completely developed. From the kidnappers who abducted him to every classmate in his high school, each has their own independent narrative and storyline. Even the people sitting with me around this campfire are the same. If I were to ask any one of them about their life story, they could tell it to me in full detail. Additionally, the political landscape and geographical features of the entire world, even every plant, snake, and insect in these forests—some of which are similar to those in my original world and some completely unique to this one—are clearly exclusive to this world——”</p><p>There was still silence on the system’s side, but Shen Kong had long been used to it playing dead and continued undeterred: </p><p>“But none of these elements are what a love story novel, especially one centered on romance, would spend time depicting. This world-building transcends the narrative of the story.”</p><p>He paused, but the silence persisted. It was as if the system had vanished entirely from his mind.</p><p>Shen Kong lowered his eyes, his gaze falling on his hand illuminated by the campfire, with traces of dirt still lingering in the lines of his palm:</p><p>“I’ve sensed the incongruity here before, but it wasn’t until now, in this jungle, that I finally gathered enough evidence. After all, I’m familiar enough with primitive jungles to discern different species—it’s not surprising that things in the novel are identical to reality since it can be explained by the default transplantation of real-world concepts. But why is there a different background construction beyond the main plot?” </p><p>He paused and asked calmly:</p><p>“So, where did these things, which the author couldn’t possibly have put effort into describing, come from?</p><p>——In other words, is this world I’ve entered truly from a book?”</p>
