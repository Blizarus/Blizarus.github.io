See you there! 👋🏻</p><p>Han Li slept uneasily. </p><p>His whole body was as burning hot as raging fire and, at the same time, it was as piercingly cold as if he had fallen into an ice cave.</p><p>Countless roars and broken phantoms pushed and enveloped him as pushing and squeezing lumps of color rushed to occupy his sight.
</p><p></p><p>He saw a pale wrist hanging down in the darkness. The bones were so thin that they protruded from under the delicate skin, resembling broken, dry twigs. It was as if he could witness life draining from the skin and flesh rapidly, bit by bit.</p><p>Han Li shuddered——he still remembered that hand, warm and soft, gently stroking his back. </p><p>Then, swallowed by the disease, it quickly withered and became emaciated, like a skeleton covered with flesh and skin.

</p><p>He moved with difficulty, attempting to catch that hand, but the rapidly spreading darkness swallowed up the pale wrist in the blink of an eye, leaving Han Li searching in vain in the darkness, crying out in panic and horror: “……Mother!”</p><p>At this moment, an irresistible force suddenly overwhelmed him, tightening around his throat with suffocating strength. Han Li struggled, almost hearing the bones in his throat cracking in the man’s palm. The pungent scent of sweat and the strong odor of gunpowder invaded his mouth and nose, mingling with the taste of blood. He heard a foreign voice whispering in the dark, uttering an unfamiliar language with malicious undertones.</p><p>Dizziness, pain, fear, and despair.

 </p><p>It transformed into countless dark monsters, opening their bloody mouths and approaching Han Li with a hideous grin.</p><p>“Bang——”</p><p>At this moment, a loud sound rang out, as if piercing through the boundary between illusion and truth, between dream and reality—like a deafening bell. It suddenly pulled Han Li out of the insane and chaotic darkness, leaving him bewildered. After blinking, everything in front of him appeared shrouded in a dazzling halo. The pale ceiling lights and light blue ceiling spun rapidly in his blurred vision, almost making him think that he was still in a dream.

</p><p>The air was filled with the strong smell of disinfectant and traces of blood. </p><p>Han Li blinked his unfocused eyes with difficulty, his forehead was burning hot. His chapped lips opened and closed slightly, uttering a vague grunt.</p><p>Beside the bed, the beeping sound of instruments was particularly disturbing and ear-piercing. Through the thin wall, it seemed that countless noisy and chaotic sounds could be heard in the distance——footsteps, muffled groans, and the sound of firearms—all merged into a noisy and chaotic sound. Like a stream of water, it flooded into Han Li’s senses in a chaotic manner. The strong sense of uneasiness and crisis was like a sharp and cold steel needle stabbing the back of his head.</p><p>Han Li’s breathing was rapid. He subconsciously began to struggle out of bed in a daze.</p><p>“Clang!” </p><p>Le fell completely off the narrow hospital bed, the fizture on his leg hitting the edge of the bed heavily.</p><p>Although the effects of the anesthesia had not worn off, the intense pain still spread instantly along the numb nerves, causing Lan Oi to tremble and curl up, with cold sweat covering his pale forehead.</p><p>He didn’t know when the sounds outside the door began to disappear.</p><p>In his hazy state of consciousness, Han Li heard rhythmic footsteps coming from a distance in the empty silence. The hard soles of their shoes hit the concrete floor, approaching steadily, step by step. </p><p>Han Li was shaken. Immense panic struck him instantly. He was shaking violently, dragging his uncontrollable body with all his strength, crawling hard towards the distance, trying to escape from the gradually approaching danger.</p><p>The footsteps stopped beside the bed.</p><p>Story translated by Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>Han Li turned his head in alarm, trying to catch the source of the sound, but his blurred vision was still completely white.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, a strong force suddenly went up to him. Strong arms went around his back and the crook of his legs, carrying him up. </p><p>The sudden feeling of weightlessness made Han Li freeze. He subconsciously reached out and grabbed the other party’s clothes. His body, which was weak and limp due to the anesthesia, fell into the stranger’s chest.</p><p>The clear and cold breath enveloped him in an instant.</p><p>The bitter taste of green grass intertwined with the smell of hot gunpowder, and the cold metallic breath unexpectedly blended into a comforting feeling.</p><p>Han Li stopped struggling——in his chaotic subconsciousness, he remembered this smell. </p><p>Amidst the sharp sound of guns and the man’s curses mixed with a foreign accent, the same strong arms pressed his whole body against his chest. This smell enveloped him densely, blocking out all the blood and danger.</p><p>In the deep, dark night, he was tormented by pain and kept on waking up in and out. In the interval between waking up and falling into unconsciousness, he felt himself being held in the same arms in the same posture. During the sudden jolts, he could hear the other person’s chest. The rhythmic heartbeat beat steadily like a lullaby, with a reassuring magic. Amidst the whistling wind, he heard a man’s deep voice coming from above:</p><p>“Hold on, kid.”</p><p>Han Li somehow relaxed and buried his hot forehead into the other person’s arms. </p><p>Shen Kong carried Han Li in his arms and walked back to the bed, feeling a little surprised.</p><p>According to the efficacy of sedatives, even adults would not wake up until at least two hours later, but Han Li not only woke up early but even crawled out of bed and struggled to drag his body several steps away. Shen Kong didn’t know whether to be surprised or to admire his willpower.</p><p>He lowered his head and looked at Han Li in his arms, his dark eyes filled with scrutiny and interest that was hard to ignore.</p><p>The child’s pale forehead was soaked with sweat, and his cheekbones were sickly flushed. His eyes rolled uneasily under his thin eyelids. His thin little hand grasped his clothes convulsively, drowsily making its way into his embrace, appearing really pitiful. </p><p>Shen Kong bent over and put Han Li back on the bed. When he was about to straighten up, he found that the hem of his clothes was still tightly grasped.</p><p>His eyebrows furrowed slightly as he reached out, trying to free the hem of his clothes from his little hand, but surprisingly, he couldn’t pull it off.</p><p>Shen Kong had a headache.</p><p>He had just dealt with a wave of mercenaries sent by the Han family outside. Although he didn’t know when the next wave would arrive, the other party probably wouldn’t give up so easily. He couldn’t waste time here. </p><p>But even if one’s sense of morality was as weak as Shen Kong, one couldn’t just break off a child’s hand.</p><p>He patiently coaxed: “Be good, let me go.”</p><p>Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>He still couldn’t pull it off.</p><p>Shen Kong’s forehead twitched. He used his hands’ strength skillfully, but he still couldn’t break free without hurting Han Li. He began to lose his patience and threatened with gritted teeth: </p><p>“Kid, if you don’t want me to get rid of your hands, take them off……”</p><p>Han Li’s pale and thin fingers clenched a little tighter.</p><p>Shen Kong: “……”</p><p>Suddenly, the system’s mechanical voice sounded in his ears: “It has been detected that the task target is in a comatose and fragile state. It is recommended for the rectifier to gently comfort them to reduce the impact of stress trauma on the task target’s three views and enhance the task completion——” </p><p>After hearing the system’s words, Shen Kong suddenly became enlightened.</p><p>Yes, Han Li is in a coma, and it’s indeed useless to think about arguing with a comatose person!</p><p>He took out a pocket knife from his pocket, cut open a piece of his cloth that Han Li was holding on to, then turned around and walked out without any hesitation.</p><p>System: …… </p><p>It couldn’t help but fall into deep self-doubt: Don’t they speak the same language???</p><p>.</p><p>Three hours later</p><p>Shen Kong took out the deflated cigarette case from his pocket and skillfully poured it into his blood-stained palm—— </p><p>It was already empty.</p><p>He threw the cigarette case aside with some regret, letting the sticky scarlet blood on the ground dye the outer edge of the cigarette case an ugly maroon.</p><p>There were several empty magazines scattered around him, as well as several metal bullet casings that were still slightly warm.</p><p>Since the situation this time was not as critical as the previous life-and-death fight on the barren mountains and these mercenaries were far less disgusting to him than the kidnappers, Shen Kong controlled the extent of his attacks. In close combat, he would only stun them, and even though he was forced to use firearms, he only targeted non-lethal parts to lessen unnecessary trouble later. However, this doubled up the difficulty this time. </p><p>Shen Kong turned his shoulders slightly and hissed softly.</p><p>The blue-purple horizon outside the window had already turned gray dawn, and the morning breeze had diluted the pungent smell of gunpowder in the room.</p><p>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>Shen Kong frowned and looked down at his wrist watch: 4:45.</p><p>It had been nearly 12 hours since he sent a message to Han Li’s grandfather. Logically speaking, the Zhao family’s people should have arrived by now, no matter how late it was. </p><p>Shen Kong had an ominous premonition in his heart. He quickly walked to the desk and turned on the computer.</p><p>The page was filled with news:</p><p>The holding company of the Zhao family is under suspicion for engaging in a business scam. The police are currently investigating the primary suspect, and the funds of the company have been frozen.</p><p>The author has something to say: </p><p>System: Fucking straight guy, I’m going to report you</p>
