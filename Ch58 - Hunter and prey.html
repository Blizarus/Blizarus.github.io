                    <p>The release of this makeup photo instantly exploded across all websites. The reposts and comments on the Weibo posts by Pei Xiuran and the official account skyrocketed. It generated such a huge influx of traffic that Weibo temporarily crashed, forcing the company to call in programmers overnight for emergency repairs.</p><p>In just half a day and one night, the name Meng Mingxuan became the most frequently mentioned term on all social media platforms. </p><p>He nearly blew up all related topics, with an almost terrifying number of reads and participations that continued to soar.</p><p>Even Pei Xiuran, who is always adept at playing the traffic card and creating controversy and guiding topics, had never achieved such astonishing marketing success. The highly anticipated 《Guiyuan Tower》 became the most-awaited national drama overnight. It garnered almost ten times the attention of the second place, a rare feat even in the current era of explosive traffic.
</p><p>Story translated by Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>Meng Mingxuan’s makeup photo went viral, causing his Weibo followers to surge. The previously stormy and scathing comments under his Weibo were flooded by a large influx of new fans. Although some people still firmly believed that the success was due to Photoshop, filters, and the photographer’s skills, and considered the whole affair a farce to whitewash this newcomer with connections, a significant number of rational book fans remained in a wait-and-see attitude. Nevertheless, a considerable number of bystanders had a change of heart.</p><p>Public opinion is something that is easily influenced and manipulated. With the added push from capital and the fact that Meng Mingxuan didn’t have much solid negative information against him, even without any works to his name, he quickly turned his situation around from being universally disliked to becoming a new, controversial figure gaining attention. </p><p>However, Shen Kong didn’t pay much attention to all this. He simply lowered his eyes, swiped the screen a few times, and then handed the phone back to his assistant.

</p><p>The assistant, somewhat puzzled, took the phone and, after hesitating for a few seconds, asked:</p><p>“Uh… Meng-ge, what do you think after seeing that?”</p><p>“What do I think?” Shen Kong shrugged and said, “No wonder my manager has been crazily booking endorsements and variety shows for me since this morning. So that’s the reason.”

 </p><p>However, he had already anticipated that he wouldn’t be staying long during this period. He used Pei Xiuran’s strict training occupying all his time as an excuse to push off all engagements. After all, he was currently on set. His manager couldn’t control him here, nor did they dare provoke Pei Xiuran, the industry tyrant.</p><p>The assistant was speechless. He awkwardly gripped the phone tighter, looking even more puzzled:</p><p>“Meng-ge, aren’t you happy? After all, your reputation has reversed now! You’re going to be very famous!”

</p><p>Shen Kong took a sip of his cold drink and lazily said, “Did you see how upset I was when my reputation was trashed?” </p><p>The assistant was stunned for a moment, then slowly shook his head and said, “…It seems like you really weren’t.”</p><p>He had been sent by Chengxi to Meng Mingxuan after the latter signed with the company. When he joined Meng Mingxuan, the star was already a target of universal ridicule online. Before being assigned to him, he had been worried for a long time, but over time he gained a new understanding of the star who was rumored to be a monster. Apart from being not very talkative, Meng Mingxuan was the best employer in the world—beautiful, kind-hearted, good-tempered, and with excellent acting skills. Unlike other stars, he never bossed his assistant around. The assistant was so upset by the online hate that he even went undercover to argue with the trolls several times——Thinking back, it seemed Meng Mingxuan really never cared about the online comments.</p><p>Shen Kong slowly turned another page of the script on his lap and said lightly:</p><p>“Isn’t that it, then.” </p><p>In fact, Shen Kong felt a bit dejected about his recent reversal of reputation online.</p><p>After all, he painstakingly maintained his persona for so long. Now, it collapsed without warning. Although there were still plenty of trolls online, mainstream opinion warmed significantly, catching him off guard. The viral makeup photo and the video of him killing a snake barehanded could be explained away with plausible excuses, like instinctive reactions in a crisis or the impressive results of Pei Xiuran’s acting lessons. However, making Han Li completely unsuspecting was still quite difficult.</p><p>Shen Kong could almost see his vest starting to fall apart.</p><p>If it weren’t for the fact that he hadn’t yet heard the system’s mechanical warning sound, he would have thought Han Li was about to appear in front of him at any moment. </p><p>Lowever, it had been nearly twelve hours since the premiere of “Seven Gays in the Wilderness Jhallenge,” but there had been no reaction from Lan Oi at all. This puhhled Shen Kong.</p><p>Something felt off.</p><p>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>While Shen Kong was lost in thought, his assistant looked at his calm profile with admiration. A phrase instinctively popped into his mind:</p><p>Could this be… the state of neither being pleased by external gains, nor saddened by personal losses? So amazing! </p><p>He clenched his fist secretly, determined to register a few more dummy accounts to control the comments——Although Meng-ge didn’t care, as a mere mortal, he didn’t have such high moral awareness.</p><p>I must protect the best Meng-ge in the world!</p><p>Shen Kong: “?”</p><p>He watched, baffled, as his assistant suddenly turned and left with a determined look on his face. For a moment, he was at a loss. </p><p>…What’s going on now?</p><p>At that moment, the phone in his pocket suddenly buzzed twice. Shen Kong took it out and glanced at it. He found a message from Tang-ge, urgently asking him to go to the parking lot immediately. The tone was very urgent, as if there was something very important to discuss.</p><p>Shen Kong furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p>It seemed his premonition was correct. </p><p>Something must have changed behind the scenes that significantly reduced the reliability of previously determined times and locations. Now, he could only adapt as best as he could. However, the immediate priority was to figure out what Tang-ge wanted from him. Perhaps he could get some clues for his next steps.</p><p>Shen Kong stood up, gave a few simple instructions to the people around him, and hurriedly headed to the location mentioned in the message.</p><p>The underground parking garage was cold and damp. A chilly wind slowly blew out from its depths, pressing Shen Kong’s thin shirt tightly against his skin.</p><p>The light at the end of the garage was broken. The pale overhead lights cast cold, flickering shadows on the concrete floor. </p><p>Shen Kong’s gaze briefly swept over the surveillance camera not far above his head.</p><p>Several hidden wires hung behind the camera, dangling emptily in the air. The motionless lens seemed to have long been cut off from its power source.</p><p>Without showing any emotion, Shen Kong slowly stepped into the garage.</p><p>Tang-ge’s voice came from not far away: “Mingxuan, over here!” </p><p>He walked toward the direction of the voice. After only a few steps, several figures lunged out from the shadows. A cloth soaked with some substance was pressed towards Shen Kong’s mouth and nose. Unexpectedly, Shen Kong, as if he had eyes on the back of his head, swiftly ducked. His elbow struck the abdomen of the person behind him with precision and force. The blow landed on the most vulnerable part of the body, causing the person to double over in pain, curling up and wailing.</p><p>Seeing this, the others hurriedly rushed forward and tried to overpower Shen Kong with their numbers.</p><p>Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>But they didn’t expect the seemingly fragile young man to move in the next second. He managed to evade all attacks at critical moments and efficiently bring down his enemies. Each movement maximized the strength of every muscle, resembling a poised cheetah ready to tear out its prey’s throat in an instant.</p><p>In a flash, the roles of hunter and prey were reversed. </p><p>A man in black, who had just rushed out of a nearby car, saw the chaotic scene and frantically drew a gun from his waist. Before he could aim, the young man, who had been several steps away, leaped in front of him in the blink of an eye. A crisp sound of bones breaking echoed through the silent garage. A few seconds later, the intense pain finally registered.</p><p>He collapsed, clutching his twisted, backward-bent arm and screaming in agony.</p><p>The young man stood against the light, looking down at him. His facial features were blurred and distant, but the cold, emotionless gaze locked onto him.</p><p>Shen Kong bent down to pick up the discarded gun. His long, fair fingers deftly played with the heavy steel. He spoke calmly: </p><p>“A Colt MK2 revolver. Not bad.”</p><p>He narrowed his eyes slightly, pressing his foot on the man’s throat, and slowly asked:</p><p>“Who sent you… hmm?”</p><p>As his nasal tone rose, the pressure under his foot gradually increased. The man below him clawed at Shen Kong’s shoe, gasping for breath in a desperate struggle. </p><p>Suddenly, an unusual commotion came from not far away.</p><p>Shen Kong quickly looked up in the direction of the noise. From the back seat of the vehicle the man had emerged from, a familiar face peeked out of the car window, staring at him in shock. The man’s face was pale, his glasses askew, and his hands were tightly bound, showing an expression as if he had seen a ghost.</p><p>Tang-ge?</p><p>A sudden realization struck Shen Kong. He looked down at the men writhing on the ground in pain, his gaze scanning their contorted faces. </p><p>Although they had black hair and eyes, their high noses and deep-set eyes clearly indicated they were foreigners.</p><p>He glanced at the Colt in his hand and recalled the content of his second main mission——to prevent Han Li from inheriting Feminster II’s underground forces.</p><p>Shen Kong slightly eased the pressure under his foot and asked in English:</p><p>“Are you from Feminster II?” </p><p>The man coughed violently, clutching his throat in fear, but did not answer.</p><p>Shen Kong narrowed his eyes. “You must have cleared everyone out before coming here. The surveillance cameras have been taken care of too. I have all the time in the world to deal with you, so I suggest… you tell the truth.”</p><p></p><p>The man stopped coughing in terror and then slowly nodded under Shen Kong’s gaze.</p><p>“Are you taking me to see Han Li?” </p><p>The man nodded again.</p><p>“Does Han Li know?”</p><p>The man shook his head.</p><p>Shen Kong roughly understood the current situation. In the storyline, the news that prompted Han Li to kill those people ruthlessly included not only Han Zizhuo’s attempt to kill him but also the true cause of his mother’s death. This information was leaked by Feminster II’s forces. Additionally, there was a list of families related to his mother’s death. This was not just for revenge but also to ensure Han Li fully turned to their side and became the heir. The best way to achieve this was to stain his hands with blood—and they succeeded. After killing his biological father and stepmother, Han Li used an iron fist to take control of all the dark forces, becoming a ruler straddling both the underworld and legitimate worlds, and began his purge of other families. </p><p>In the original story, Meng Mingxuan did not participate much in this plot.</p><p>But things changed after Shen Kong arrived.</p><p>Given the current situation, Meng Mingxuan was seen as the traitor who betrayed Han Li to Han Zizhuo.</p><p>So they sent people to bring Shen Kong to confront Han Li and used him as a pawn to push Han Li completely into the abyss. </p><p>Shen Kong’s mind raced. His expression instantly softened. He bent down and, ignoring the man’s desperate attempts to retreat, forcefully helped him up.</p><p>With a pleasant demeanor, he said, “Why didn’t you say so earlier?”</p><p>Under the man’s bewildered gaze, Shen Kong clasped his wrists together and extended them towards him with a smile:</p><p>“So, when do we leave?” </p><p>The author has something to say:</p><p>Tang-ge, who witnessed everything: ???</p>
