    <div class='content'>Shen Kong soon met Han Li’s subordinates and friends.<br/>They had long known that their resolute and cold-faced boss had someone on his mind. <br/>Lin Ziyu thought it was Cheng Chen.<br/>In his imagination, it was a youthful and passionate love that was separated by fate, a story of high school sweethearts torn apart and changed by time and circumstances.
<br/><br/>Zhao Yun thought it was Meng Mingxuan.<br/>In his imagination, it was a domineering CEO and an 18th-tier small celebrity—a melodramatic love story filled with intense emotions and the struggles of social status and identity. <br/>In some ways, both of them were not entirely wrong.

<br/>In any case, upon learning that Han Li had finally found his true love, both of them were very pleased.<br/>This time, their imaginations finally aligned.<br/>They envisioned a beautiful and healing story of a pure and cute little white flower who would mend the heart of the wounded and paranoid head of the Han family.

 <br/>So when Shen Kong walked in, they were dumbfounded.<br/>The man in front of them was nearly 1.9 meters tall, with broad shoulders, a slim waist, and long legs. His rolled-up sleeves revealed muscular and smooth forearms covered with scars of varying depths. He had a high nose, deep-set eyes, and sharp, angular features. His cold eyes swept over them with a chilling intensity that felt like it could slice through flesh.<br/>He squinted his eyes and revealed a lazy smile. His voice was low and magnetic:

<br/>“Hello.” <br/>Zhao Jun and Lin Ziyu were silent for a long time.<br/>It wasn’t until Han Li followed Shen Kong in, his pitch-black eyes coldly sweeping over them and bringing a gust of chilly air, that Zhao Yun and Lin Ziyu finally regained their composure. They stiffly forced smiles and stammered:<br/>“He–Hello, hello.”<br/>Han Li, satisfied, retracted his gaze. <br/>Shen Kong seemed to remember something and turned to say something softly to Han Li. Han Li smiled. There was a gentle and restrained light in his eyes that Zhao Yun and Lin Ziyu had never seen before. It wasn’t until the two walked closer that they could hear their conversation clearly.<br/>“…You can eat, but don’t cook.”<br/>“Why?”<br/>“I’m afraid you’ll blow up the villa’s kitchen too.” <br/>“Then how about takeout?”<br/>“Uncle Xu will scold us.”<br/><br/>Their conversation was brief, stopping only when they stood in front of the two men. But the intimacy and ease in their words made Zhao Yun and Lin Ziyu’s eyes almost pop out of their sockets. They would never have imagined such warm and casual talk coming from their ruthless and cold-blooded boss.<br/>They stared in shock at the scene before them, almost suspecting they had traveled to a parallel universe. <br/>It wasn’t until Lan Oi shot them a cold glance that they snapped back to reality.<br/>Shen Kong patiently asked again, “So, where are my identification documents?”<br/>Oin Iiyu nodded vaguely and turned to point at the document bag on the table.<br/>They had heard that Han Li was infatuated with an unknown man, but because Han Li protected him so well and carried such an intimidating presence, no one dared to inquire. This time, they heard that his lover’s replacement ID documents had been delivered to Han Li’s office, so the two of them, eager for a spectacle, rushed over to see what the man in the photos looked like. <br/>Before they could even touch the document bag, the man himself appeared before them.<br/>Shen Kong opened the document bag, glanced inside casually, then handed it to Han Li. Han Li, without complaint, took it and held it, his expression natural and calm.<br/>Zhao Yun and Lin Ziyu’s jaws dropped once again.<br/>The two started chatting amongst themselves: <br/>“So, where do you want to go?”<br/>“Europe, Africa, just travel around.”<br/>“Okay.”<br/>“And you? Since you made the suggestion, is there any place you want to go?” <br/>“I actually…”<br/>Lin Ziyu sensed something was off. He looked at Han Li in alarm. “Han-ge? Are you going abroad?”<br/>Recently, he had been nearly crushed by the workload Han Li suddenly threw at him, which almost made him wonder if he had somehow offended him. He thought he was about to get some relief, but now it seemed he was about to leave again——<br/>His vacation——! ! ! <br/>Lin Ziyu’s heart bled, while his soul wailed.<br/>Han Li nodded without a hint of guilt on his face. “Yes.”<br/>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>Seeing their crestfallen faces, he mercifully explained, “We’ve been hounded by Shen Kong’s fans and the buzzing media. We need a break to relax and lay low. We’ll be back soon.”<br/>Fans…? <br/>Media…?<br/>Shen Kong…? ? ! ! ! !<br/>The two, who never followed the entertainment industry, stared at Shen Kong’s chiseled face and suddenly realized——This was the recently popular star of 《Guiyuan Tower》! No wonder he looked so familiar earlier! And connecting this to his new position as a director at Chengxi Entertainment, they instantly understood——Fuck, Han-ge really went all out to pursue him!<br/>Shen Kong glanced at Han Li teasingly, “You’re the one who can’t handle it, right?” <br/>Han Li admitted openly, “Yes, I’m jealous.”<br/>Shen Kong smirked, “And some people call you the nation’s husband and the face of entrepreneurs. Should I be jealous?”<br/>Han Li laughed, “I wouldn’t mind at all.”<br/>Zhao Yun and Lin Ziyu: “……” <br/>They felt like they were being slapped in the face with cold dog food.<br/>Come on, could they pick a better time and place for flirting?<br/>After a brief exchange of greetings, the two left together, leaving Zhao Yun and Lin Ziyu muttering behind them:<br/>“What do you think, with that height and looks… can our Han-ge handle it…” <br/>“I think… it might be tough…” Zhao Yun hesitated.<br/>Before they could delve deeper, Han Li’s cold voice drifted over from afar:<br/>“Talking about the boss behind his back, one month’s salary deducted.”<br/>Their faces fell again. <br/>That evening, when they saw the posts on Weibo from Shen Kong and Han Li and the ensuing uproar, Zhao Yun and Lin Ziyu couldn’t help feeling a bit of schadenfreude.<br/>Finally, they weren’t the only ones whose three views were turned upside down now.<br/><br/>Heh heh.<br/>Han Li and Shen Kong, two normally-sized men, squeezed together on a single sofa, making it seem overly crowded. The two phones that had just created a global sensation were already thrown far away. <br/>Their bodies fit together seamlessly.<br/>Han Li stared into Shen Kong’s eyes.<br/>In the darkness, his eyes had an enchanting glow.<br/>Han Li leaned in to kiss his lips. The man lying down responded just as eagerly. Their breaths were warm and intertwined, almost addictive. <br/>Breathing heavily, Han Li pressed his forehead against Shen Kong’s and said in a low voice:<br/>“This morning, you asked me if I had any place I wanted to go…”<br/>“I remember you didn’t answer me.”<br/>Han Li nodded slightly, his breath still unsteady. “Yes.” <br/>He naturally averted his eyes, but his entire body tensed instinctively. His voice remained steady, almost unchanged:<br/>“Now, I have a place I want to go.”<br/>They were so close that Shen Kong could clearly sense Han Li’s emotional shifts. He gently kissed Han Li’s temple to comfort him:<br/>“Go ahead.” <br/>“This season, there’s a church in the Netherlands with beautiful flowers outside…”<br/>Han Li’s muscles tensed like a drawn bowstring.<br/>Shen Kong chuckled softly, his firm chest vibrating with laughter. He exchanged a brief kiss with Han Li, then replied:<br/>“Okay, let’s go see it.” <br/>Three months later.<br/>The long-dormant official account finally posted its second Weibo.<br/><br/>No words.<br/>Just a simple picture. <br/>Two slender hands were intimately entwined, with rings on their fourth fingers glinting brightly.<br/>The author has something to say: It’s officially finished! Thank you for your company!<br/>The prince and prince have finally come together after much hardship!<br/>Although my story is over, theirs continues (wink) <br/>——<br/>By the way, humbly asking for a five-star review, please!<br/>KEIGHTY: Hi, this is KEIGHTY!
