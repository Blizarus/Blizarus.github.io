    <div class='content'>KEIGHTY: Special thanks to Evelyn for the ko-fi! I hope you guys enjoyed the shower updates! ( ˘ ³˘)♡ (Extra Chapter 5/5)<br/>Han Li threw the phone in his hand on the table, then closed his eyes and leaned back on the chair. <br/>His eyebrows were frowning irritably, his lips were stretched tight into an indifferent straight line, and his cheekbones were sickly flushed. His whole person seemed to be on the verge of bursting out.<br/>The window curtains were tightly drawn, blocking out most of the light. The room was filled with an almost hazy gloom. Only the screen of the mobile phone on the table shone with a faint light, illuminating the unprocessed documents scattered on the table.

He took out two aspirin pills and swallowed them in his mouth.<br/>Ever since he left Cheng Chen’s downstairs that day, he started to have a fever. <br/>The family doctor couldn’t find out the specific cause, so he was forced to guess that it might be caused by catching a cold in the rain that day. No matter what medicine he prescribed, it didn’t help. Only aspirin could barely suppress the severe pain that was roaring in his head.

<br/>But for some reason, Han Li vaguely understood from the bottom of his heart that…<br/>The low fever and headache this time did not seem to be related to physical causes such as being exposed to the rain.<br/>He frowned. He leaned his head back on the soft leather chair and raised his hand to pinch the bridge of his nose.

 <br/>Under the tightly closed eyelids, the eyeballs showed incomparably strange halo transformations due to the pressure——clear scenes suddenly appeared in front of his eyes without warning: a moonless night, a pitch-black, shining muzzle, and… an endless fall.<br/>Han Li abruptly opened his eyes, beads of sweat already covering his forehead before he knew it. He gasped for breath heavily, a look of unsettled fear flashing in his pitch-black eyes.<br/>——Yes, these past few days, as long as he closed his eyes, scenes from that strange dream would appear in front of him.

<br/>Moreover, it seemed as though new details were added to the blurred and broken fragments each time, as if a skilled and masterly painter were augmenting outlines and colors to his paintings little by little, making those unclear scenes gradually become coherent and vivid. Those dark and gloomy scenes rolled out of the dream, instantly swallowing up and occupying his mind like a tide. Every minute and every second was lifelike, as if he had experienced it personally. <br/>He could even smell the kidnapper’s warm, foul-smelling breath in the cold night, feel the rough friction of the rope on his wrist, and taste the blood spreading in his mouth——<br/>Along with his leg bones and knees suddenly being punctured and broken.<br/>Han Li often had to reach out and touch his limbs below the knees, just to make sure there weren’t empty trouser legs there.<br/>Just then, his cell phone rang again. <br/>Lan Oi reached for his phone and answered it, his voice hoarse and low, with a hint of impatience:<br/>“…Speak.”<br/>The voice over there sounded a little distorted through the receiver, but it seemed ezceptionally clear in the duiet room:<br/>“Han-ge, we have found the gangsters who blocked you before. It seems that new forces have come to the east side of the city recently. We investigated, and it seems that they are spreading rumors connecting you to our side. Not many believe it, but it incited a few brainless scums to come trouble you. This matter shouldn’t have much to do with the Han family——if I’m not mistaken, there are new players in the city.” <br/>The space between Lan Oi’s brows wrinkled deeply. Le stared pensively at the half-folded city map not far away on the table, a stern look flashing in his eyes.<br/>He said slowly:<br/>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>“Continue investigating. This is a critical period for PUZZEL’s expansion. No accidents must happen.”<br/>Unlike that strange dream, in the original kidnapping incident, his legs were fortunately saved in time. Although he suffered serious sequelae, at least he could still walk, albeit with difficulty. <br/>The man’s unintentional brief remarks at that time forced Han Li to look straight at all the clues that he was unwilling and did not dare to look into.<br/>Doubt is like a seed. Once planted, it will grow lush branches and leaves.<br/>The cause of his mother’s death, his kidnapping, the decline of his grandfather’s family, and the stenching water stains oozing out of the dark mud hidden under the grand and wealthy appearance of the Han family caused people to feel chilled all over.<br/>His last bit of attachment and hope for this family was extinguished, and being associated with the Han family made him feel sick. <br/>In order not to invite death and for the sake of his long-term layout, Han Li voluntarily left for the provinces in a low-key manner for the reason of putting his family first. Then he secretly developed his own power in areas beyond the Han family’s reach, creating his own prototype of an empire, and PUZZEL was the starting point of his journey. With it as the core, Han Li secretly developed a series of industries. The scale was not too large and did not attract the attention and vigilance of the Han family, but it still covered all the focal and critical points of the industries.<br/>And now was the critical point for PUZZEL’s expansion to reach a higher level. Even Han Li did not dare to relax his vigilance.<br/>So even though he had a headache, he still stayed on the top floor of PUZZEL to process and handle official business.<br/>Without any warning, the sharp brows and eyes of a young man drenched in the rain suddenly flashed through his mind. Han Li paused. He opened the conversation interface with Lin Ziyu, calmly stared at it for a while, and then slowly turned off the screen—— <br/>He sincerely hoped that Cheng Chen had nothing to do with this matter.<br/>.<br/>Lin Ziyu didn’t go directly to class. Instead, he turned around and walked to the dessert shop next to the school. He bought a portion of all the desserts and breads displayed on the counter, filled a large bag, and then whistled as he walked towards Cheng Chen’s classroom.<br/>His mood was as sunny and cheerful as the weather. <br/>You know, in all the years he and Han Li have known each other, this was the first time that he had shown clear interest in someone.<br/>And he actually asked himself to help deal with the gangsters who harassed him! He also specifically reminded himself to pay close attention to him in school!<br/>——Wow!<br/>According to Lin Ziyu’s understanding of Han Li over the years, this level of attention was definitely unusual! <br/>Lin Ziyu’s gossipy heart, which had been quiet for many years, finally started to burn brightly. Eight hundred versions of love and hatred were outlined in his mind along the way.<br/>As he walked, he thought wildly:<br/>Story translated by Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>After all, even he, who prides himself on being faithful, has had several girlfriends over the years, while Han Li’s romantic history has always been a blank slate. Could it be that after all these years, Han Li’s reason for ignoring those who showed interest in him has finally been found? The reason for preserving his purity for so many years is actually due to gender incompatibility!<br/>Lin Ziyue turned his head and looked behind him with a guilty conscience. <br/>He was a little afraid that Han Li would suddenly come out from a corner, stare at him with those scary black eyes, and then ask slowly: What were you thinking about just now?<br/>But… No matter what, building good relationships is always the right thing to do! After all, Han Li also reminded him to take good care of that person, right?<br/>Lin Ziyu casually stretched out his hand to pull a student who came out of the class. He stuffed a large bag of bread, cake, and sandwiches into his arms and naturally ordered: “Give it to Cheng Chen. Just say it was given by Han Li.”<br/>——Improving relationships, perfect. <br/>The student was scared out of his wits. He asked stammeringly:<br/>“Wha, what?”<br/>Lin Ziyu raised his eyebrows: “Don’t you understand?”<br/>The student was so frightened that he hurriedly shook his head, then walked into the classroom quickly as if running away, put the things on Shen Kong’s table, and whispered: “That, that, Han Li gave it to you.” <br/>Shen Kong was lying on the table, asleep, unconscious of his surroundings. He was abruptly awakened by a bag of things suddenly falling onto him. Then he subconsciously raised his eyes and looked outside the classroom.<br/>There was not a soul in sight outside the classroom.<br/>Lin Ziyu felt more and more aware that he had done a great deed, so he turned around and left without leaving his name, following Lei Feng's example, he whistled happily as he walked towards his own class.<br/>Seeing that there was no one at the door, his expectation of them going back was shattered. <br/>Shen Kong unhurriedly got up. He took out a sandwich from it and took a bite without any trace of politeness, saying to the system sincerely:<br/>“If I had known earlier that being a good person would get me free breakfast, I might have started a long time ago.”<br/>System: “…”<br/>The other students who witnessed this scene in the classroom were all wide-eyed and speechless, not daring to believe their own eyes for a moment: <br/>Does Cheng Chen know Lin Ziyu? And Lin Ziyu actually gave Cheng Chen breakfast?? What happened to the world???<br/>Xu Linsheng, who was sitting in the corner of the classroom, was also shocked. His once handsome face was now marred by the arrogant look that never left him. He reached out and pulled the classmate who had just helped bring in the things, asking in disbelief: “Was that Lin Ziyu just now?”<br/>Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>The classmate nodded with a grimace and stuttered: “Yes… He said it was given by Han Li.”<br/>Cheng Chen not only knew Lin Ziyu, but also knew Han Li??? <br/>The look of surprise on Xu Linsheng’s face deepened. He let go of the classmate and said to his follower beside him: “Have you invited Cheng Chen to come to my birthday party tonight?”<br/>His follower was dumbfounded for a moment: “Young master Xu, didn’t you say you don’t want that nerdy poor guy to be an eyesore in front of you?”<br/>Xu Linsheng reached out and slapped the back of his head. He said in shame and anger: “Nonsense, I never said that. Hurry up and invite him.”<br/>His follower nodded hurriedly. He had just run a few steps away when he suddenly turned back and said hesitantly: <br/>“That… Young master Xu, what should we do if he refuses?”<br/>Xu Linsheng sneered: “How is that possible? My party is being held at PUZZEL. A lot of people have been lining up for months to get a seat. This may be the only opportunity for this poor guy to go to such a high-end occasion in his lifetime.”</div>
