                    <p>After school, Shen Kong slung his backpack over his shoulder and walked out of the school gate.</p><p>Before he could take a few steps, he was stopped by an old but loud voice. </p><p>He turned his head in the direction of the voice and saw an old man with a robust figure and gray temples standing by the roadside, his face stern yet kind.</p><p>“You must be classmate Cheng Chen.”
</p><p>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>Shen Kong stood still, narrowing his eyes slightly. “Yes.”</p><p>The old man bowed to Shen Kong with a smile on his face. “Hello, I’m Uncle Xu, the young master’s housekeeper. He asked me to pick you up after school today.” </p><p>He stepped aside, revealing a sleek black car behind him. He elegantly opened the car door for Shen Kong and said:

</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>Shen Kong furrowed his brow, somewhat surprised. He asked in his mind to the system that had been silent for a long time, “Is this the housekeeper who died at the critical point in the plot?”</p><p>The system replied, “Yes, after Uncle Xu’s death, Han Li’s personality underwent a drastic change. The originally suppressed malice and hatred in his heart were triggered and began to develop towards extreme ruthlessness and extremism after the beginning of the main plot. It was a necessary transformation for him to become the paranoid and ruthless villain in the later stages of the plot.”

 </p><p>Shen Kong hoisted his backpack up. “I never expected the housekeeper to come pick me up.”</p><p>He bent down and sat in the car, fastening his seat belt.</p><p>Uncle Xu walked to the other side, got in, and started the car.

</p><p>The engine hummed as the car slowly started and drove off into the distance. </p><p>In the sanatorium.</p><p>Han Li pushed open the door to the ward but involuntarily halted his steps.</p><p>The spotlessly white ward was clean and tidy, with the clear air tainted red by the setting sun outside. A faint smell of disinfectant lingered in the room as well.</p><p>Le felt an unusual sense of unease. </p><p>Lan Oi’s heart was filled with complez feelings, making it almost impossible to clear the chaotic thoughts in his head. Lis chest heaved, and he felt his heart gradually beating faster.</p><p>——The presence of this person in the room had become almost like an unremovable thorn.</p><p>As time passed, this thorn grew deeper and deeper until it almost became a part of his body.</p><p>Apart from feelings of gratitude, there was a deeper sense of doubt. </p><p>He was originally a member of the kidnappers, so why would he give and help him without reservation? Not even seeking any reward?</p><p>Han Li subconsciously rubbed the palm lines of his left hand with his fingers—</p><p></p><p>Between the deep lines, it seemed as if there were still traces of cold, sticky blood, deeply imprinted in his palm like ferocious scars.</p><p>Memories buried in the depths of his mind resurfaced, vivid and clear, as if they had happened yesterday. Han Li almost had the illusion that if he closed his eyes, he would instantly return to that dark, moonless night, once again becoming that desperate and helpless child. </p><p>The cold muzzle, the pungent smell of gunpowder smoke, and the rough hemp rope.</p><p>All the sensory memories surged like a tide, deeply imprinted in Han Li’s mind, making it impossible for him to forget even for a moment.</p><p>His desperate drive over the past few years almost entirely stemmed from this—fear of powerlessness, disdain for weakness, and desire for revenge.</p><p>That night shaped him. </p><p>Han Li took a deep breath and walked steadily into the ward, his gaze naturally turning towards the direction of the hospital bed.</p><p>The man who had saved his life eight years ago was sitting on the bed.</p><p>His head and legs were bandaged, one arm was in a splint, and the other hand was handcuffed to the bed rail. Although his face bore the marks of years and wind and frost, the contours of eight years ago could still be discerned.</p><p>But… those eyes were completely different from his memory. </p><p>As if the eight years of fugitive life had worn away his dashing spirit, enveloping his whole being in an unmistakable sense of desolation and the declining spirit of middle-aged men.</p><p>The man looked at him with unfamiliar eyes, as if he didn’t remember Han Li at all.</p><p>It wasn’t until he pulled a chair and sat opposite him that his face finally showed a look of realization:</p><p>“Oh, you’re the young master I saved.” </p><p>Han Li didn’t answer. He just slightly furrowed his brows and stared deeply at him, trying to find any trace of his memory on him.</p><p>But he failed.</p><p>The man named Zhou He got up straight, a glimmer of hope flashing in his previously despondent eyes and a hint of smile on his face— it was a smile familiar to Han Li, with intentions and hidden meanings, friendly yet ingratiating.</p><p>“I knew you wouldn’t forget me. There aren’t many people who know how to repay kindness nowadays…” </p><p>Han Li lowered his gaze, concealing his deep thoughts. He paused and said, “I’m indeed very grateful for your help back then. It’s thanks to you bringing me to the hospital for treatment in time that I saved my left leg. If you need anything, feel free to tell me.”</p><p>Zhou He’s eyes brightened. He moved his hand, which was handcuffed to the bed rail, making a clinking sound of metal collision:</p><p>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>“You see, even though I was involved in your kidnapping, in the end, didn’t I repent and turn over a new leaf? So… I don’t know if there’s any way you can let me off the hook…”</p><p>Han Li raised his eyes to look at him. His cold and deep face was expressionless, and his dark eyes seemed to have been tempered with ice: </p><p>“You’re not him.”</p><p>Zhou He froze, staring at Han Li with his mouth agape. The young master who had been polite and harmless just now seemed like a living demon, pressing forward step by step, catching him off guard for a moment. He forced a smile on his face. “You… what are you talking about…”</p><p>Han Li stood up, his face icy and full of hostility. “Who sent you here?”</p><p>Before Zhou He could answer, Han Li slowly advanced, his oppressive aura terrifyingly low. “What’s your purpose? Who gave you the forged identity information? How did you manage to pull off this face?” </p><p>A barrage of questions bombarded Zhou He, almost leaving him breathless.</p><p>Zhou He realized that there was something wrong with what the other party just said, so he gave up struggling. He leaned back as if surrendering and said:</p><p>“Believe it or not, I have no purpose. No one sent me, there’s no forged identity, and I was indeed one of the kidnappers who abducted you. The leader was someone I knew from my time with the Armenian gang abroad. He suddenly approached me and told me that there was a good deal. As long as we kidnapped the child and brought them to the designated location to be killed, we would get a hefty sum of money. At that time, I happened to be a little short of money, and besides, I was only responsible for looking out, so I agreed.”</p><p>Han Li stood at the foot of the bed, looking at Zhou He sitting on the bed with some confusion. </p><p>Every detail matched up.</p><p>Even… he could clearly feel that the other person was telling the truth.</p><p>Then, Zhou He continued, “Then we went to the designated location the customer told us about that day and successfully kidnapped the person. While on the way, I felt somewhat tired and fell asleep… and then I don’t remember anything.”</p><p>Han Li was stunned. “…What?” </p><p>Zhou He blinked slowly, his bloodshot eyes becoming lifeless again. He shrugged as if giving up the struggle. “Anyway, when I regained consciousness, I found myself lying on the grass. My whole body was sore and my leg was injured. Only after coming down from the mountain and watching the news did I realize what probably happened during the days I lost my memory.”</p><p>Han Li’s mind was a little confused. He pursed his lips, trying to organize his thoughts:</p><p>“So, you mean you have no memory of those days?”</p><p>KEIGHTY: Hi, just a quick translator’s note!
