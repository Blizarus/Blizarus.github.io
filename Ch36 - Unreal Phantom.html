                    <p>Shen Kong’s brow twitched, almost thinking that the familiar mechanical warning sound would ring in his mind the next second.</p><p>——But it didn’t. </p><p>Shen Kong felt relieved and once again wore the perfect mask that belonged to Meng Mingxuan.</p><p>He got up from the bed in a bit of a panic, looking half fearful and half nervous at Han Li standing at the door, stammering:
</p><p>Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>“President—President Han? Why are you here?”</p><p>Han Li’s brow furrowed slightly as he quietly observed him, his dark eyes brooding. </p><p>The beautiful young man standing by the bed seemed increasingly uneasy under his gaze, his slender fingers by his side twisting the hem of his sleeve.

</p><p>The furrow in Han Li’s brow deepened.</p><p>He looked at Meng Mingxuan for a long time, until the other’s pale ears turned red, then finally, out of a sudden burst of kindness, broke the heavy silence in the room:</p><p>“You know me?”

 </p><p>Meng Mingxuan nodded vigorously: “Yes, in the entertainment circle now, who doesn’t know…”</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, he seemed to realize the impropriety of his words, so he hastily cut off the tail end and lowered his head in embarrassment.</p><p>Han Li lowered his eyes, his distinct knuckles lightly stroking the top of his cane, and then said:

</p><p>“It’s nothing, I just heard about the commotion earlier and came to check on you.” </p><p>He raised his eyes to look at Meng Mingxuan again, his deep voice restrained yet polite: “Whenever it comes to matters related to film and art, Xiuran becomes extremely intense. Throwing things at you was out of line, and I will make sure he personally apologizes to you.”</p><p>Meng Mingxuan hurriedly waved his hand, stammering a bit: “No, no, no, I understand. Director Pei has high standards for art, it’s not personal. There’s no need for him to…”</p><p>He trailed off.</p><p>Han Li gazed at him and took over the conversation, continuing nonchalantly: “Then I can expect to see you on set, right?” </p><p>Meng Mingxuan looked stunned, as if this news had left him completely disoriented:</p><p>“On set? But, but… the audition?”</p><p>Han Li raised an eyebrow indifferently, the major role’s assignment coming out of his mouth as lightly as deciding where to eat dinner: “Xiuran has already decided that you are his Shen Guiyuan. Even the company’s higher-ups can’t change his mind. As long as you are willing, the role is yours.”</p><p>Meng Mingxuan, struck dumb, nodded in a daze, as if still reeling from the shocking news: </p><p>“O… Okay…”</p><p>Seeing that he had received a definite answer, Lan Oi gave him a slight nod, then turned and left the infirmary.</p><p>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>As the crisp sound of the cane and leather shoes tapping on the floor gradually faded away, the ezaggerated and sincere ezpression on Shen Kong’s face instantly softened, like clouds drifting across a clear sky. It dissipated with a breehe, leaving only the clear and profound firmament beneath.</p><p>He leaned back casually, as if nothing could capture his attention. </p><p>His amber eyes narrowed slightly, staring absentmindedly at the empty doorway.</p><p>Although the plot’s direction had caught him off guard for a moment, Shen Kong had also made a rather comforting discovery——while the current Han Li was quite different from the image in Shen Kong’s memory, he was clearly much more cheerful and sunny compared to his original character in the plot. This gave Shen Kong a sense of relief, like an old father. Sure enough, his efforts at the previous two plot points had not been in vain.</p><p>Just then, the system’s voice suddenly sounded:</p><p>“The studio has received the rectifier’s request and has responded to the relevant situation.” </p><p>Shen Kong was startled. His eyebrows became solemn as he listened carefully to the system’s next words:</p><p>“The studio detects the rectifier’s exposure risk by monitoring the spiritual threshold of the book’s world. If anyone in the world links the rectifier to their past identity through concrete evidence or learns about the rectifier’s purpose, the spiritual threshold will spike. The studio’s detection system will then assume an exposure risk, forcibly extracting the rectifier from the current timeline.”</p><p>Shen Kong pondered for a moment and asked:</p><p>“So, only when someone, through evidence, confirms my identity, will there be an exposure risk, is that correct?” </p><p>He emphasized the words “through evidence” and “confirms.”</p><p>The system’s emotionless mechanical voice sounded in his ear: “If you understand it that way, then yes, that’s correct.”</p><p>Shen Kong fell into deep thought.</p><p>He recalled the events of the day he was forcibly transmitted. </p><p>First, Han Li’s unexpected visit the night before, followed by his sudden invitation——</p><p>It all seemed somewhat off.</p><p>The next day, Han Li did not come to school all day.</p><p>After school, while Shen Kong was on the way back to his house with the housekeeper, the system’s warning sounded, followed by the car accident and the forced extraction. </p><p>This indicated that during this period, someone had definitively learned his identity and obtained real evidence, rather than baseless speculation.</p><p>Shen Kong recalled the note Han Li left him the next morning: “Had urgent matters today, took the day off. See you after school.”</p><p></p><p>What was Han Li’s urgent matter that day?</p><p>Was he handling something, or… meeting someone? </p><p>Shen Kong’s heart skipped a beat as he grasped the fleeting thought that had just crossed his mind. He asked seriously, “By the way, I remember asking you before about what happens to my temporary identity after I leave. You said they remain unharmed but don’t remember the period when I replaced them, correct?”</p><p>The system replied, “Yes.”</p><p>Shen Kong took a deep breath, a bold guess forming in his mind. He pursed his lips slightly and said to the system in his mind:</p><p>“I think I know how I got exposed last time.” </p><p>Now that he knew the cause——</p><p>Then he could be more careful this time.</p><p>Han Li left the infirmary and slowly walked down the empty corridor. The sound of his cane tapping the floor matched the sound of his footsteps, creating a steady, rhythmic beat on the ground.</p><p>Just as he turned the corner, a voice called out to him: </p><p>“——Hey.”</p><p>Han Li turned toward the voice and saw Pei Xiuran leaning against the wall at the corner. His expression had returned to calm and peaceful, showing no signs of the earlier agitation and extremity. Pei Xiuran straightened up and walked toward Han Li, teasing as he approached:</p><p>“I didn’t know that the esteemed President Han would actually take the time to care about the living conditions of a small actor.”</p><p>Han Li gave him a cold glance: “——At least I wouldn’t throw things at him.” </p><p>Pei Xiuran wasn’t angered by the jab. He just quietly looked back at Han Li, as if scrutinizing something.</p><p>After a few seconds of silence, he suddenly and unexpectedly asked:</p><p>“Are you still looking for that person in your heart?”</p><p>Han Li frowned. The aura around him instantly turned icy: </p><p>“That’s none of your business.”</p><p>Pei Xiuran sighed, “The media always say I’m extreme and obsessive, but I think you’re no better——I’m chasing my muse, but what you’re chasing is even more unreal. Ever since I met you in college, you’ve been searching for this… phantom in everyone around you. You probably invested in my film for this very reason. It’s been eight years, why haven’t you woken up?”</p><p>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>He shrugged and continued:</p><p>“Even though I agreed to help you find someone like Shen Guiyuan, that doesn’t mean the person I find will be the one you’re looking for. After all, this is the entertainment industry. Actors live by their acting skills. Even if someone has a similar personality, the chance of them being the same person is incredibly slim.” </p><p>Han Li’s dark pupils suppressed a hidden flame as he gave Pei Xiuran a warning look, his gaze as icy as a blade.</p><p>——In some ways, he deeply resented Pei Xiuran’s incredibly sharp insight, but on the other hand, it was this very insight that allowed Pei Xiuran to perceive Han Li’s deeply repressed and hidden side. This was how their paths crossed and gradually developed into the friendship they have now.</p><p>Pei Xiuran didn’t dwell on the topic further but smoothly shifted the conversation:</p><p>“However, since you’re already here, I have to ask——do you think this Meng Mingxuan could be the lover of your dreams?” </p><p>This time, Han Li hesitated. He slowly shook his head and said:</p><p>“…I’m not sure.”</p><p>Pei Xiuran was a bit surprised. “Not sure? That’s rare. In all these years, this is the first time I’ve seen you uncertain.”</p><p>Han Li didn’t respond. He simply lowered his eyes and slowly rubbed his fingers against his cane, as if deep in thought. </p><p>Pei Xiuran suddenly became excited, the previous gentle and calm demeanor stripping away from him once more. A certain obsessive, almost pathological emotion surfaced from his eyes like the tip of an iceberg emerging from the sea:</p><p>“However, this Meng Mingxuan is an uncut jade. He’s very raw and clumsy in many areas, with heavy traces of imitation, but he is definitely an uncut jade…”</p><p>Pei Xiuran’s tone suddenly grew more intense, as if he were intoxicated by the fantasies in his mind:</p><p>“——As long as I can carve him to perfection in my hands, he will definitely become the perfect Shen Guiyuan! I never thought I would find him. I even started hiring people to rewrite the script without his character. I can’t believe I actually found him… it must be fate’s favor. This final product will be absolutely wonderful…” </p><p>By the end, Pei Xiuran had become incoherent again, expressing his abstract and turbulent inner world with disjointed words.</p><p>Meanwhile, Han Li, who was standing aside, listened absentmindedly. His fingers rhythmically tapped the tip of his cane, producing a faint sound.</p><p>Suddenly, as if a thought struck him, he looked up at Pei Xiuran and interrupted him with a matter-of-fact tone:</p><p>“By the way, in two days, I’ll take you to apologize to him.” </p><p>Pei Xiuran was momentarily taken aback, seemingly not expecting the conversation to take this turn. A puzzled monosyllable escaped his throat:</p><p>“…Ah?”</p><p>Story translated by Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>Han Li’s gaze turned cold and unyielding as he looked at Pei Xiuran, his dark eyes as deep as the sea:</p><p>“I believe the Pei family’s upbringing wouldn’t allow you to just brush off what happened without an apology.” </p><p>Seeing Pei Xiuran’s stunned expression, a cold, emotionless smile appeared on Han Li’s sharply defined face:</p><p>“——After all, it was you who threw the cup at him.”</p><p>KEIGHTY: Special thanks to GreenKiTea for joining me on ko-fi!
