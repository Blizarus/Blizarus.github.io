    <div class='content'>Shen Kong stood under the massive screen and numerous cameras floating in mid-air. With his eyes slightly narrowed and his hands in his pockets, his figure seemed like a tear on an infinitely extended canvas against the vast and boundless white background, strikingly vivid and intense.<br/>His eyes were a silent lead-gray. His eyelashes fragmented the light, casting it into his pupils and resembling mottled marks on steel. <br/>The mechanical voice began to systematically assess the scores:<br/>“First time node: The rectifier failed to complete the task——to heal the target character’s trauma with warmth, points +0
<br/>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>The rectifier prevented the target character’s lower limbs from being amputated, points +500<br/>The rectifier disregarded the intellectual assistant’s advice and stubbornly altered the subsequent world line, points -5000” <br/>As the mechanical voice narrated, clips from the first node played rapidly on the screen, seemingly echoing the evaluation content.

<br/>Shen Kong ignored the voice resonating through the space and quietly observed the swiftly changing scenes and texts on the massive screen before him. The shifting light and shadow cast upon his inscrutable face made it almost impossible to discern the deep emotions settled in his eyes.<br/>“Second time node: The rectifier completed the task——to heal the target character’s trauma with warmth, task completion: thirty percent, points +300”<br/>The rectifier failed to complete the task——to rectify the target character’s three views, points +0

 <br/>The rectifier conveyed incorrect three views to the target character, points -5000”<br/>The screen’s image paused on a scene of torrential rain, where Han Li, drenched and silent, was leaning against a wall while clutching a wooden stick in his pale hand. Shen Kong was lifting the man by his hand and forcing him to stand straighter. Then he smiled at Han Li: “A tooth for a tooth, an eye for an eye.”<br/>The text on the screen flowed several times faster than before. One line barely appeared before being covered by the next. It was dizzying, making it almost impossible to capture any information. After a few seconds of pause, the mechanical voice resumed the evaluation:

<br/>“Third time node: The rectifier completed the task——to heal the target character’s trauma with warmth, task completion: fifty percent, points +500 <br/>The rectifier completed the task——to rectify the target character’s three views, task completion: ten percent, points +100<br/>The rectifier completed the main mission, points +1000<br/>The rectifier exposed their identity without authorization, points -5000”<br/>The emotionless voice echoed in the vast, pale space: <br/>“Rectifier’s total points: -12600, points evaluation procedure concluded.<br/>Now proceeding with the real-time surveillance evaluation of the dimension’s subsequent events, with a maximum point of one thousand.<br/>Upon the conclusion of the real-time surveillance evaluation, if the rectifier’s points remain negative, the studio will no longer provide temporary identities for Rectifier No. 0893, and the rectifier’s mental body will lose its support.”<br/>In other words, death. <br/>Shen Kong listened indifferently, even raising an eyebrow as if this matter were unrelated to him. It seemed as though he had long become accustomed to the concept of death.<br/>The text on the screen flashed even more frenetically, streaking past his eyes like afterimages. Numerous floating cameras pointed at Shen Kong. The entire space seemed to fall into silence. Suddenly, the voice resumed: “Due to numerous requests and objections from the audience, the rectifier’s points evaluation will now include a public voting feature.”<br/>Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>Two opposing lines, red and blue, abruptly lit up on the screen, both rapidly rising.<br/>Eed signified death, blue signified life. <br/>A few minutes later, the blue line overwhelmingly claimed victory.<br/>“The results are in. The studio has decided to respect the audience’s choice and preserve Eectifier No. 0893’s mental body. The temporary contract will be converted into a long-term contract, and Temporary Eectifier No. 0893 will be promoted to a Urofessional Three Niews Eectifier. Lowever, due to the large amount of negative points accrued and the history of disobedience, the studio will determine the duration and nature of the work. The contract’s end date will be set by the studio, and the right to interpret the contract belongs to the studio.”<br/>What a happy ending.<br/>The rectifier did not lose his life, the studio gained free labor, and the livestream audience had a long-term source of entertainment. <br/>The livestream room was filled with joy, everyone was very satisfied, and joyful messages scrolled across the screen. But at that moment, a faint voice echoed in the vast and desolate space:<br/>“I object.”<br/>The voice was not loud, but a certain strange quality in it caused the entire livestream room to fall silent. Even the rapidly scrolling text on the screen paused for a moment.<br/>Shen Kong continued to stand casually under the numerous cameras aimed at him. His eyes were slightly narrowed. His expression was indifferent as he leisurely repeated: <br/>“I object.”<br/>The entire livestream room erupted: “Is he crazy? Does he know that rejecting the contract means death?”<br/>“Wuwuwu, I don’t want to see him die, I really like this rectifier’s character!”<br/>“Ahhhhhhhh, wake up, Shen-ge! What’s so good about staying in just one novel world? There are so many other novels out there. I’m really looking forward to seeing you enter other novel worlds and their plots!!! Even more people will be head over heels for you!” <br/>The screen in front of him suddenly seemed to be covered by a curtain, blocking out all the light and shadows. The next second, Shen Kong heard an anxious voice in his ear. He recognized it as the voice of the intellectual assistant that had always been with him. The system’s originally mechanical tone finally had some emotion:<br/>“Rectifier, what are you doing? I worked so hard to get you this opportunity! If you just sign the studio’s official contract, you’ll have countless temporary identities to choose from, countless lives and worlds to experience. You can become a superstar in this world! If this were a novel with you as the main character, it could go on for millions of words. You can keep playing as long as you want. What else are you not satisfied with?”<br/>Shen Kong didn’t even move an eyebrow:<br/>“Do you remember what I told you at the second node?” <br/>“…Huh?”<br/>The system choked off.<br/>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>Shen Kong continued patiently:<br/>“I’m willing to take on this loss-making task from you, not because I’m afraid of death——if I cared so much about my life, I would’ve retired long ago.” <br/>The system fell silent.<br/>Shen Kong paid no mind to its silence and calmly continued, “Back then, I told you I was an extreme hedonist, but now I need to tell you something else. I hate being manipulated and controlled, especially like this… being imprisoned under constant surveillance?”<br/>He let out a sneer. “Scram.”<br/>The system stopped trying to persuade him. The curtain covering the massive screen was lifted again, revealing the active screen and numerous cameras pointing at Shen Kong once more. <br/>The voice that filled the entire space sounded again: “Does Rectifier No. 0893 confirm the decision to forfeit the contract promotion opportunity?”<br/>Shen Kong remained indifferent and unconcerned:<br/>“Confirm.”<br/>“The points evaluation procedure is concluded. Now proceeding with the real-time surveillance evaluation of the dimension’s subsequent events, with a maximum point of one thousand…” <br/>As the voice faded, a massive chart appeared on the screen in front of him. A red line, representing danger, stretched straight across the center of the chart—this was the plot line of the original story. A white line represented the trajectory of the target character’s fate, and a blue line represented the target character’s three views orientation. If these two lines overlapped with the red line, or even continued downward, it would indicate the rectifier’s mission had failed. Meaning, the target character’s fate returned to its original course under the influence of the world line, or perhaps even worsened.<br/>However, a bizarre situation occurred.<br/>No one knew how this could happen.<br/>From the beginning, the blue line extended below the red line, even sinking deeper at an unstoppable rate. <br/>This indicated that the target character’s heart was extremely dark, exceeding even the villain standards set in the original story, to the point where triggering a nuclear bomb and annihilating humanity wouldn’t be surprising.<br/>But, conversely, the white line symbolizing the fate trajectory extended steadily and slowly upwards. From its initial dangerous proximity to the red line, it drew farther and farther away, climbing higher and higher. Based on this line, even the most charitable benefactor couldn’t compare to him.<br/>This has never happened before.<br/>Even the studio’s mechanical voice fell into a prolonged silence. <br/>Shen Kong felt a stir in his heart, his fingers instinctively tightening slightly——He didn’t expect that a casual request he made before leaving would result in this.<br/>…Han Li actually did it.<br/>Story translated by Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>Despite harboring so much darkness, hatred, and distortion in his heart, he astonishingly restrained himself and forced himself to strive toward goodness with remarkable willpower.<br/>Shen Kong couldn’t describe his current mood for a moment. It was as if a piece of the thick and hard steel armor encasing his heart had been chipped away. A certain sour and swollen emotion slowly seeped in. His soul, numbed by guns, steel, smoke, and blood, seemed to be slightly touched. This unfamiliar feeling, which had never appeared in his past thirty-plus years, left him momentarily at a loss. <br/>“Time speed adjustment.”<br/>The mechanical voice sounded in his ear.<br/>The extension speed of the two lines increased, but the overall trend and direction remained unchanged.<br/>Suddenly, at this moment, Shen Kong sensitively detected a strange fluctuation. All the lines on the screen began to tremble violently, as if some uncontrollable force was causing a severe disturbance. Immediately afterward, the pale space he was in flashed with a blinding red light. A piercing alarm sounded: “Warning, warning, Sub-world a528 is out of control. Please adjust immediately!” <br/>“Warning, warning! Sub-world a528 is out of control. Please adjust immediately!”<br/>The mechanical voice remained emotionless: “Detected fluctuation exceeds the threshold. Destroy Sub-world a528 to prevent impact on other worlds.”<br/>Shen Kong’s heart jolted. “Wait!”<br/>Before he could finish speaking, the alarm continued: “Destruction failed, Sub-world a528 is breaking free…” <br/>All the monitors floating in the air started to spin wildly. Shen Kong could almost hear the faint tremors in the space. The voice, which had always been devoid of any emotional change, now sounded noticeably urgent: “Forcefully prevent the detachment!”<br/>“Detachment prevention successful.”<br/>There was no time to catch a breath as the same alarm sounded again: “Warning, warning! Sub-worlds a001, a002… up to 3,200 sub-worlds are affected by the fluctuation, generating instability. It’s about to get out of control, it’s about to get out of control!”<br/>Large swathes of blank spaces flashed on the screen. The bewildered live audience flooded the screen with question marks, and soon the screen was shut off. <br/>Obviously, the live stream ended.<br/>The spherical cameras floating mid-air continued to spin chaotically, colliding with each other and emitting unstable electrical sounds. Shen Kong, hands in his pockets, watched the chaotic and amusing scene with fresh interest, looking laid-back and unfazed by the unfolding disaster.<br/>The mechanical voice echoed once more in the vast, empty space. For some reason, Shen Kong detected a hint of exasperation in its usually mechanical calmness:<br/>“Scanning for available professional personnel to deploy into the sub-worlds.” <br/>——“Detection complete, number: 285 people.”<br/>“Selecting the optimal option.”<br/>Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>——”Selection complete, number: 0 people.<br/>The out-of-control sub-world is about to break free from control and is rejecting high-plane personnel entry. Please reselect.” <br/>Following this was a silence, broken only by the monotonous, piercing alarm and the electrical sounds of colliding cameras. The mechanical voice, now reluctant, spoke again: “Expand the search range.”<br/>——“Search range expanded, number: 1 person.”<br/>【Rectifier No. 0893】<br/>【Transmitting】 </div>
