                    <p>Shen Kong took out a key from his pocket and unlocked the door.</p><p>A rush of stale, musty air greeted him, faintly mixed with the smell of dust and decay from a long time without cleaning. </p><p>He raised his hand and fumbled along the wall for a moment before turning on the light.</p><p>The overhead fluorescent tube flickered to life, illuminating the previously pitch-dark room. The place was a mess, with dirty clothes piled haphazardly on the sofa and floor. The floor and walls were filthy. The table was also covered with discarded trash bags and takeout containers, making the already-not-so-large rental apartment feel even more cramped.
</p><p>Story translated by Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>The original owner did not seem to be a very self-disciplined person.</p><p>Shen Kong stepped over the piles of garbage and dirty clothes on the floor and opened the balcony doors and windows to let fresh air into the stuffy space. </p><p>He moved around the room in what appeared to be a random manner, but his gaze was always precise and deliberate, as if every action was carefully considered.

</p><p>After a simple circuit of the room, Shen Kong had a fairly good understanding of the previous occupant’s character.</p><p>——Vain, self-centered, ambitious, and not well-educated.</p><p>He sat down on the sofa, took out his phone, and browsed through the contacts and chat records of the original owner.

 </p><p>Meng Mingxuan’s chat records could be summarized in six words:</p><p>Fawning, sycophantic, and eager to please.</p><p>He seized every opportunity to climb the social ladder, racking his brains to find every possible avenue for exposure.

</p><p>Shen Kong had encountered many people like this before. </p><p>He closed the chat application and searched online for the web series and part-time roles that the original owner had participated in——It wasn’t difficult to find. The original owner had saved all his screen appearances in his phone’s favorites folder, including some marginal offline interviews.</p><p>Shen Kong lowered his eyes and watched them attentively, the light from the screen reflecting on his face and flickering in his dark pupils.</p><p>Since he had decided to uncover the true purpose of this so-called “Three Niews Eectifying Studio,” he needed to stay in this world for as long as possible to have a chance to uncover the truth. Therefore, he had to avoid the crisis that occurred last time to prevent the system from epecting him from the timeline again.</p><p>He was always all or nothing. </p><p>Perfectly playing and replacing someone was never an easy task. Shen Kong had previously encountered missions that required him to fully integrate into a new identity, but those usually required at least three months of training and preparation, starting from the smallest details—mannerisms, body language, pronunciation, intonation—all were critical.</p><p>This time, the timeframe was quite tight, so Shen Kong could only mimic within the limited conditions available.</p><p>Just then, a message notification popped up on his phone screen. It was from someone named Chai-ge:</p><p>“Mingxuan, have you set off for Director Wang’s office tonight?” </p><p>Shen Kong remembered that this guy named Chai-ge was Meng Mingxuan’s manager. The original owner was signed to a small company, and this manager had about similar small artists under his wing, similar to Meng Mingxuan's situation. He rarely paid attention to anything outside of their schedules.</p><p>After a pause, Shen Kong opened the chat interface between the two.</p><p>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>Before he could reply, a new message popped up from the other side:</p><p>“If you haven’t left yet, don’t bother going. I have a great opportunity for you here, which seems perfect for you. I think you have a good chance this time. I’ll drive over to your building to pick you up later. I’ll call you when I get there.” </p><p>This time, his attitude was unusually enthusiastic compared to their previous conversations.</p><p>Shen Kong squinted slightly and replied in Meng Mingxuan’s tone:</p><p>“Okay, no problem! Thanks a lot, Chai-ge, for helping me in my career. I won’t let you down this time for sure.”</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Shen Kong’s phone rang. He answered the call, and a slick voice came from the other end of the line: </p><p>“Mingxuan, I’m here. Come down.”</p><p>Shen Kong hurriedly descended the stairs and saw a thin, middle-aged man waving at him through the rolled-down car window.</p><p>He opened the car door and got in.</p><p>Chai Zhi flashed him a warm and intimate smile. “Mingxuan, you’re here! Tonight, I’ll take you to meet some big shots at a great place. This is the opportunity you’ve been waiting for. If you’re chosen, your future will be limitless. You can have as many resources as you want in the entire entertainment industry. I’ve always believed that you’re the most talented kid I’ve ever brought up. I only approached you for this great opportunity. My other artists have no idea about it.” </p><p>Shen Kong’s face lit up with surprise, as if his whole face were illuminated by the desire and longing for fame and fortune:</p><p>“Really?! Thank you, Chai-ge!”</p><p>Then, he hesitated, pursed his lips, and after a moment of silence, he asked somewhat uncertainly, “But, um… Chai-ge, can you tell me what we’re auditioning for tonight? I want to prepare…”</p><p>Chai Zhi looked around mysteriously, making sure no one was listening, before speaking: </p><p>“Oh, don’t ask too much. Just know that it’s related to some big shots upstairs. Preparation won’t help much anyway. They won’t select based on how well you’re prepared. They care more about your inherent qualities.”</p><p>After saying this, Chai Zhi didn’t want to reveal any more information. Shen Kong had no choice but to stop asking further questions.</p><p>The car stopped at the entrance of a nightclub.</p><p>Chai Zhi and the security guard at the door whispered to each other for a while, then Chai Zhi led Shen Kong straight into the venue. </p><p>The interior of the club was magnificent. Even the decorations in the corridor were visibly valuable. The high ceiling was covered with intricate platinum-colored patterns. Chai Zhi and Shen Kong walked into the elevator designated for members. Chai Zhi pressed the button for the top floor.</p><p>The elevator ascended slowly.</p><p>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>In the elevator, Chai Zhi kept telling Shen Kong about the etiquette after entering. Shen Kong pretended to listen carefully, but in fact, he didn’t listen to a word he said.</p><p>The elevator stopped. The decoration on this floor was even more luxurious and splendid than on the first floor. However, the wall lamps in the corridor were dim and soft, creating a quiet and comfortable environment. The whole corridor was silent, with hardly a sound to be heard. </p><p>Chai Zhi confidently led Shen Kong towards a distant place, stopping at the door of a private room at the end of the corridor. He turned around, lowered his voice, and said to Shen Kong:</p><p>“After you enter, don’t speak. Just wait quietly. No need for any unnecessary actions, understand?”</p><p>Seeing Shen Kong nod, Chai Zhi opened the door and pushed him inside.</p><p>The light inside the room was so bright that Shen Kong had to squint to adapt to the sudden change in lighting conditions. </p><p>Upon entering, he discovered that there were already about a dozen young people inside, who appeared to be of similar age to him. They stood in a neat row, each with delicate and handsome features and tall and slender figures. However, they all seemed to share some peculiar similarities with each other.</p><p>Shen Kong’s expression became subtle.</p><p>It was because he noticed that Meng Mingxuan’s face also bore some resemblance to these young people.</p><p>And it was this similarity that gave him an inexplicable sense of familiarity when he saw Meng Mingxuan’s photo. </p><p>But he couldn’t recall where he had seen it before.</p><p>KEIGHTY: Drop your guesses as to who does Meng Mingxuan resemble! Go go go gooo!</p>
