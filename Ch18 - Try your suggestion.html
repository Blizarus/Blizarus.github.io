                    <p>Shen Kong took a swift step forward and supported Han Li who was sliding down.</p><p>Feeling that the limbs under his palm were hot beyond the normal range, Shen Kong furrowed his brow and reprimanded: “Didn’t I ask you to wait in the room?” </p><p>Han Li shook his head muddle-headedly, as if trying to discern the meaning of Shen Kong’s words. After a long time, he raised his head, his moist eyes staring at Shen Kong’s face, and suddenly smiled:</p><p>“I’m a little worried about you.”
</p><p>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>Shen Kong was tongue-tied for a moment, not knowing how to respond.</p><p>At this moment, the power-cut elevator at the end of the corridor buzzed and shook twice, and the floor button that had been black for a long time lit up. It seemed that someone finally discovered something unusual about this floor and sent someone to solve the problem. </p><p>With a “ding” sound, the elevator door opened, and almost at the same time, the locked stairwell on the side was also suddenly knocked open.

</p><p>Security personnel in uniforms rushed into the corridor that was empty just now. A young man in a gray suit walked quickly to the front, his frowning brows filled with unconcealable anxiety.</p><p>When he saw Shen Kong and Han Li, who were being supported by him, he ran forward, turning pale in fright. Looking at Han Li, who was unsteady on his feet, he felt somewhat awkward when he spoke:</p><p>“What happened? This…”

 </p><p>When Shen Kong raised his head and looked away, Han Li instantly stopped his pure and gentle demeanor and stared at the man coldly, with an obvious threat in his sinister eyes.</p><p>The young man was choked off by the glare. He subconsciously swallowed the latter half of the sentence in his throat and quickly changed his tone:</p><p>“This… This friend, how is he? Is he injured in any way?”

</p><p>Shen Kong glanced at Han Li, who looked listless and sick, and answered for him: </p><p>“He has a fever, nothing else.”</p><p>The man breathed a sigh of relief, then turned to the bodyguards behind him and coldly ordered: “Control all these irrelevant people and find out how they got in. Attendants, go to the private room to check on the guests.”</p><p>After the methodical orders were given, the number of people in the corridor instantly decreased.</p><p>The young man turned his head and looked at Shen Kong again, saying with a kind face: “I’m sorry to disturb you. Our hotel will try our best to compensate you for your losses. Here is my business card. You can contact me directly for any future matters.” </p><p>Shen Kong raised his eyebrows and suddenly asked, “Are you the boss here?”</p><p>“No…”</p><p>As soon as the words came out, the young man clearly felt an ice-cold and terrifying gahe cast from a distance. The smile on his face frohe, as if a thorn was pickling down his back. Le did not dare to look back and added somewhat stutteringly: “The boss… Le is not in the hotel today.”</p><p>Feeling that the gaze on him finally slowly withdrew, the young man seamlessly breathed a sigh of relief. </p><p>Shen Kong took the black business card, glanced at it briefly, and stuffed it into his pocket.</p><p>The young man asked respectfully: “Excuse me, where are you going to go next? The hospital? After all, your fright tonight is also the result of our hotel’s lax safety and security. We can prepare a car to take you to your destination.”</p><p>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>Before he could even speak, Shen Kong felt the arms around his neck tighten slightly.</p><p>Han Li pursed his lips, his eyes watery, and said weakly: “…I don’t want to go to the hospital.” </p><p>The young man took a deep breath, forced himself to look away from the other person, and hypnotized himself in his mind——He’s not my boss, he’s not my boss, he’s not my boss…</p><p>Shen Kong frowned: “Will you be okay with your fever?”</p><p>Han Li rested his head on his shoulder, his voice hoarse and vague: “…Going to the hospital won’t be useful, I just need some good sleep.”</p><p>Shen Kong was originally thick-skinned and hard-hearted, so he nodded: “Okay, where’s your home address? Tell this gentleman…” </p><p>“Zhao Yun.” The young man quickly reported his name.</p><p>But Han Li remained silent at this moment.</p><p>Shen Kong reached out and pulled his face up, only to see that his eyelids were closed tightly, his eyelashes hung down quietly, and his cheeks were burning hot.</p><p>It seemed he had fallen asleep. </p><p>Zhao Yun: “……” He obviously still had the energy to glare at me just now.</p><p>Shen Kong felt like he was getting a headache, but he couldn’t forcefully wake him up with everybody watching, so he turned to Zhao Yun and said, “Forget it, I’ll take him to my house.”</p><p>After speaking, he smoothly rattled off an address.</p><p>Zhao Yun didn’t dare to neglect him and quickly found someone to prepare the vehicle. As soon as he turned around, the calmness on his face collapsed into pieces, revealing an expression as if the sky were falling——it’s over, he actually witnessed the cold boss acting spoiled online today. He might get silenced!!! </p><p>Shen Kong helped Han Li into the car and then got in the car from the other side.</p><p>The vehicle slowly drove away from PUZZEL’s entrance, and the dim lights traced on the windows blurred as the speed increased, smearing on the smooth and cold windows like stretched golden silver lines.</p><p>He turned to look at Han Li, who was sleeping in the back seat, and narrowed his eyes slightly, seemingly thinking deeply about something.</p><p>At this moment, the system that had been feigning death for a long time jumped out in Shen Kong’s mind, forcefully injecting a heartfelt tone into its otherwise mechanical and boring voice: “What a good child he is, ah. Rectifier, do you have the heart to continue treating him with that kind of indifferent and negative attitude you had before? It’s still not too late to change his three views now. This can prevent him from being opposed by all, deserted by his friends, and dying alone in the future. Moreover, once the task fails, your accumulated points as the Rectifier will also be cleared to zero. The loss outweighs the gain, ah.” </p><p>“Are you insinuating that I’m slacking off in my work?”</p><p>Shen Kong hit the nail on the head.</p><p>Story translated by Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>System: ……Aren’t you?</p><p>It had long witnessed Shen Kong’s ability to twist the truth and focus on the key points, so it could only stifle its indigation and continue to say: “No, that’s not what I meant. As an assistant system, I suggest that the rectifier should have more contact with the task target. The formation and rectifying of three views does not happen overnight, and it is not enough to just prevent the task target from being bullied and humiliated according to the plot. To rectify the target, you must use your patience and care to influence him and let him embark on a healthy and normal path from now on.” </p><p>The car jolted, causing Han Li’s head, which was tilted behind the seat, to sway and slide down. The dark hair on his forehead was spread out in a mess, blocking his tightly closed eyes.</p><p>The neon lights flashing continuously outside the car window streaked across his red cheeks, casting deep shadows on his deeply contoured features. Amidst the shadows, one could vaguely see the image of the boy with tear-stained cheeks at that time, stubbornly silent as ever.</p><p>Shen Kong narrowed his eyes slightly and carefully examined Han Li’s calm face for a while.</p><p>He hesitated for a rare moment, and then calmly said to the system in his mind: </p><p>“Okay, I will try your suggestion this time, but there’s one condition——do not interfere with my way of doing things.”</p><p>.</p><p>Shen Kong had his eyes lowered, the cigarette dangling from his lips hung downward, and his empty palms were half-closed.</p><p>With a “click” sound, blue green flames shot up from the metal lighter, leaving a flickering blaze on his face. </p><p>The night outside the window was dim, and the old and mottled windows were half-open. The silent night wind blew from the window, blowing away the pale-white and misty smoke.</p><p>This scene was exactly what Han Li saw when he woke up.</p><p>The thin young man was sitting on a chair by the window, his slender legs crossed and a slender cigarette held between his fingers.</p><p>Amidst the smoke, his gentle and handsome facial features revealed an ice-cold sense of detachment. He gazed out the window with his eyelids half-closed, with some kind of carelessness and indifference, as if he couldn’t care about anything. </p><p>Han Li fixedly stared at him for a long time before slowly exhaling.</p><p>He propped up his upper body with his arms, climbed up slowly, looked around, and found out that he was lying on the bed at Cheng Chen’s home.</p><p>The soft touch of the washed and starched quilt came under his fingertips, as if he could still vaguely smell the reassuringly light breath of the young man.</p><p>Han Li furrowed his brows, trying hard to recall his previous memories. </p><p>Perhaps due to the high fever, his previous memories seemed to be shrouded in a layer of hazy mist, almost giving him the illusion that he was still in a dream.</p><p>The last scene in his mind was that he was helped into the car by Cheng Chen. Immediately afterwards, the state of consciousness he had forcibly maintained before was overwhelmed by the surge of drowsiness and fatigue, quickly losing consciousness as the vehicle started.</p><p>Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after Han Li fell into a deep sleep, the strange and lifelike nightmare that kept repeating did not appear again. Han Li couldn’t remember what else he dreamed about, only vaguely recalling some broken and fragmented memories——a misty rain, wet fingers, and the smell of crushed green grass on his fingertips.</p><p>The author has something to say: </p><p>Shen Kong: After slacking off at work for so many days, I’m finally ready to work!</p><p>System: …Why do I always have an ominous premonition?</p>
