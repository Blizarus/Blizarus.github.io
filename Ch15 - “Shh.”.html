    <div class='content'>The night gradually became darker, the blue sky was smudged with dark ink, and the dim clouds blocked the afterglow of the setting sun.<br/>Shen Kong stopped in front of a low-key detached building not far away. He looked up and saw a simple English word imprinted on the brief yet well-designed logo; <br/>“PUZZEL”<br/>The other students around him excitedly whispered in low voices, chattering incessantly about Xu Linsheng’s birthday celebration.
<br/>Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>——That he comes from a well-off family, attends a prestigious school, has means and resources, and also looks pretty good.<br/>Basically, he is the winner in life in school. Even though he is arrogant and self-important, many people still show respect for him. <br/>Shen Kong leisurely followed behind them and listened to the whole story of this man without batting an eyelid.

<br/>In fact, there was no other reason why he followed them except that…<br/>He had seen Xu Linsheng’s name in the plot——he was the one who dug out Han Li’s true identity as the abandoned son of the Han family. He was also the one who took the lead in ostracizing and bullying him out of envy and malice. It was also him whose eyes were brutally gouged out by Han Li at a certain plot point.<br/>Shen Kong turned his head and seamlessly scanned the students around him. As expected, he did not see Han Li’s figure among the crowd.

 <br/>After all, in the plot, before the protagonist transferred, Han Li was a semi-vacuous existence in the entire class. Coupled with Xu Linsheng’s indescribable hostility towards him from the very beginning, it’s not surprising that he wasn’t invited to his birthday party this time.<br/>Xu Linsheng, who was walking in front of the crowd, showed the card in his hand to the attendant guarding the entrance.<br/>The group of people walked into PUZZEL smoothly.

<br/>The interior decoration inside the door was unexpectedly simple, and the appearance of the building itself was more like a collection of certain concepts, horizontally and vertically arranged, with sharp and decisive lines, carrying a distant feeling devoid of emotion, but when integrated together, it exuded a different charm. It was quite distinct from the luxurious extravagance that Shen Kong had once frequented, even the air here lacked the decadent scent of high-end clubs. <br/>Shen Kong raised his eyebrows, a little surprised by the boss’s taste.<br/>PUZZEL had a total of six floors. Their group was led into a private room on the fourth floor. Compared with the angular designs in the lobby, the decoration inside the private room was gentler and more gorgeous. The surrounding light beams were like bead chains surrounding the neck, wrapping the room tightly and making the entire private room appear sparkling and pleasing to the eye.<br/>Wu Oinsheng took a seat in the middle of the private room. All the other invited students also sat down in succession according to their prozimity to him.<br/>Shen Kong very consciously chose a location in the blind spot of the light, sitting down low-key and duietly. <br/>Jolorful drinks were served like flowing water, and the private room was duickly filled with buhhing chatter and the collision of glasses. The atmosphere in the entire room gradually became more active, the music gradually turned intense little by little, and the lights gradually dimmed. The people’s boldness seemed to be getting stronger and stronger under the influence of darkness and alcohol, and the scale of the games played in the center of the room was getting bigger and bigger.<br/>Shen Kong sipped the fruit juice in the cup boredly, looked around the place, and yawned without interest.<br/>He stood up from his seat and left the private room without attracting anyone’s attention.<br/>The corridor was quiet, and the soundproof walls sealed the noisy music in the room. Only when the door was opened and closed could one hear a note spilling out of the private room. <br/>Shen Kong went to the smoking area to take a smoke, and then asked an attendant for the toilet’s location. As soon as he walked around the corner, he heard voices talking not far away:<br/>A deep male voice asked irritably: “…Where did that Cheng Chen go? Why can’t he be found anywhere?”<br/>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>Another person stammered: “I don’t, I don’t know. No one saw him going there.”<br/>Shen Kong narrowed his eyes slightly——he wasn’t familiar with either of these two voices, but they seemed to be particularly familiar with him, and… they had bad intentions. <br/>He shifted slightly, found a more secluded place to hide, and continued to listen.<br/>“…Not even in the private room?”<br/>“Ye, yes, all of his classmates said they didn’t see him.”<br/>The irritable male voice lowered his voice and cursed: “Trash! I already told you the location, but you still can’t find that person? I should have broken your legs in the inner venue a long time ago!” <br/>Venue…?<br/>Shen Kong was stunned for a moment, a vague guess forming in his mind. He leaned out slightly and looked in the direction of the sound through the dim light in the corridor.<br/>He saw two men standing face-to-face at the end of the empty corridor. The man with his back to Shen Kong was tall and strong, revealing signs of martial arts training from his ankles and wrists, while the man currently facing Shen Kong happened to cower in fear and expose his face under the light.<br/>It was a skinny face with a sallow complexion from lack of sleep. His cowering eyes moved shrewdly and greedily in the sunken eye sockets, as if always scheming some shady ideas. His lips were thin and dark, and his cheekbones were high and protruding, giving him a mean and dispirited look. <br/>Shen Kong’s pupils suddenly tightened, feeling as if his head was exploding and splitting from the pain.<br/>The system’s alarm sounded in his ears, but it was as if it were isolated by glass. It became blurry and distant, almost indistinguishable.<br/>Countless unfamiliar scenes suddenly sprang up in his mind.<br/>The boy, who was much smaller than his peers, curled up tightly into a ball in the corner. The paper-thin door panel could not isolate the endless beatings and abuse outside the door. The woman’s cries and screams were covered up by the sounds of kicks and insults. All he could hear was a distorted voice that suddenly broke out amidst the chaos, shouting non-stop: “Give me the money! Where’s the money?! Bitch, where did you hide the money?!” <br/>In the plain and dark mourning hall, an older boy kneeled in front of a woman’s black-and-white photo, crying in grief. A man rushed in anxiously, with a red and greedy light flickering in his deeply sunken eyes. He kicked the boy away, forcefully took from his hand the burial money he borrowed from relatives and neighbors, and said in an incoherent and muddle-headed manner: “Dad will win back all the money he lost soon. When I earn money, I will buy her a mahogany coffin. If dad still doesn’t pay the money back, that person will break his legs…” He said as he rushed out of the door.<br/>The scene slowly faded from his mind, and the halo hanging at the top of the corridor, which had been vaguely circling in front of his eyes, gradually stabilized in the end.<br/>The system’s voice in his ears finally became clear: “…the temporary identity’s emotion has been triggered. Rectifier, please pay attention and don’t be too affected.”<br/>Shen Kong raised his head and looked at the cowering man standing at the end of the corridor again. <br/>He found the memory of that ugly face in his mind. It was none other than Cheng Chen’s gambler father——Cheng Zekang.<br/>It seems that it has something to do with the casino he went to that day. Although Shen Kong was confident that nothing would happen to him, what he didn’t figure out was… why did these people choose to block him at PUZZEL?<br/>Story translated by Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>He breathed lightly and listened quietly.<br/>“I don’t believe it. The elevator has been cut off, and all the staircases are guarded by our people. Where could he possibly run to? Go and find him!” <br/>Just as the man’s voice fell, there was suddenly a commotion of footsteps coming from the corridor ahead. Three tall and burly figures appeared from the other side of the corridor, walking towards Cheng Zekang and the other person.<br/>Shen Kong agilely retreated along the darkness, skillfully maneuvering past the corner behind him and disappearing from their field of vision just before they could look over.<br/>He held his breath and hid in the shadows. Suddenly, a hoarse and bewildered voice came from behind him:<br/>“…Cheng Chen?” <br/>Shen Kong abruptly turned his head, only to see Han Li standing not far behind him, gazing at him with brows slightly furrowed. The light from the corridor above shone down onto his head, dividing his sharply contoured face into a painting of intertwined light and darkness, yet his entire face was tinged with a peculiar flush.<br/>Shen Kong didn’t know if it was just his illusion, but he felt that… the look in Han Li’s eyes seemed somewhat distracted?<br/>He turned his head and glanced at the surroundings, the confusion on his face deepening. He asked slowly: “What floor… are we on now?”<br/>Shen Kong: “…” <br/>It seems that it was not just his illusion.<br/>At this moment, Cheng Zekang’s warning voice came from not far behind him: “I hear someone over there!”<br/>“Let’s go and take a look!”<br/>Shen Kong’s eyes turned cold. He stretched out his hand to pull Han Li, pushed open the nearest door, and slid in with his body sideways. <br/>In the darkness, he pressed Han Li against the wall, covered his mouth and nose with his palms, and whispered in a low voice:<br/>“Shh.”<br/>The author has something to say: Before I knew it, it’s already chapter fifteen!</div>
