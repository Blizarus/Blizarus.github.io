    <div class='content'>Shen Guiyuan’s casting choices quickly blew up on social media.<br/>Along with the soaring popularity of the show came a frenzy of digging into the past of the young actor Meng Mingxuan. The resourceful netizens unearthed all his past credentials and shows he had participated in. Compared to the veteran actors and current stars in 《Guiyuan Tower》, his meager string of web drama experiences seemed pitiful. On top of that, Meng Mingxuan’s awkward acting made all the netizens feel shocked and puzzled. <br/>Another trending topic slowly climbed to the top:<br/>​#MengMingxuanBackstage#
<br/><br/>Numerous baseless rumors spread more and more convincingly online. Besides many marketing accounts getting involved, a lot of fans of actors who didn’t get the role also muddied the waters. In summary, the consensus was that there was definitely a shady deal in Shen Guiyuan’s casting choices—boiling down to one core idea: this actor, whose only redeeming quality is his looks, must have relied on connections to be forcibly inserted into the crew!<br/>It’s not like there weren’t a few weak voices supporting Director Pei’s casting decision. They suggested that if Meng Mingxuan could pass Director Pei’s selection, he must have some merit. However, these voices were quickly drowned out by a flood of outraged criticism and were labeled as brain-dead fans of Meng Mingxuan. <br/>The official account and Meng Mingxuan’s latest Weibo post received hundreds of thousands of negative comments. Meng Mingxuan then became the most vilified person online for a time.

<br/>Qi Yi was scrolling through Weibo in the makeup room, watching countless abusive and filthy comments flash across his screen. A barely concealed look of schadenfreude flickered in his downcast eyes.<br/>He hadn’t gotten the role of Ji Anyi because Pei Xiuran thought his face looked “too superficial.” In the end, he had used all his connections to finally secure a second or third-tier role in 《Guiyuan Tower》. He even bragged about it to his friends for a long time.<br/>——And now, with today’s official announcement, Meng Mingxuan was actually chosen to play Shen Guiyuan?!

 <br/>Qi Yi clenched his fingers in frustration, his fingertips turning white from the pressure. He took a deep breath and glanced down at the endless stream of hateful comments on his phone screen, finally feeling a bit more balanced inside: So what if Meng Mingxuan got the role through connections? He still faced public backlash, didn’t he? Being the target of online hatred must be a terrible experience, right?<br/>Thinking of this, a maliciously satisfied smile appeared on Qi Yi’s face.<br/>On the other side, Shen Kong was indeed at home browsing Weibo.

<br/>While eating snacks, Shen Kong watched the endless stream of witty insults and insinuations in the comments section with great interest, clicking his tongue in amazement. <br/>In his original world, he never had time to play with social media. His usual interactions involved guns and blades, moving swiftly from one mission to the next with little attention to entertainment news—unless, of course, one of his clients happened to be a celebrity.<br/>So… this feeling was quite novel.<br/>Therefore, Shen Kong had no qualms about rejecting his agent’s request to disable comments. Instead, he happily scrolled through Weibo and occasionally used a small account to stir up arguments and fan the flames, watching the chaotic battlefield with satisfaction—as if the person at the center of the online attacks wasn’t himself.<br/>Defore he could finish having his fun, his phone received a new message from his agent, informing him that the opening ceremony for 《Xuiyuan Tower》 was scheduled for tomorrow. <br/>The nezt second, an unknown call came in, notifying him:<br/>Lan Oi would be present at the opening ceremony.<br/>Mollowing his employer’s instructions, Shen Kong dressed in what was described as “clothes that Lan Oi would like,” then fully eduipped himself with a mask and a baseball cap before heading out.<br/>This was almost the biggest inconvenience that the skyrocketing notoriety, due to being universally hated online, had brought to Shen Kong’s life. <br/>It was only at this point that he finally realized why being obscure was the best protection.<br/>The main issue, however, was that Meng Mingxuan’s contracted agency was truly awful. They couldn’t even provide a secure apartment or a reliable means of transportation. Shen Kong couldn’t always rely on Chai Zhi to drive him around as well. Therefore, he had to take some money from Meng Mingxuan’s meager savings to buy a car for daily travel.<br/>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>During times like these, Shen Kong wished the rumors on Weibo were true.<br/>——After all, according to those marketing accounts, he was supposed to be living a lavish life, pampered by a wealthy benefactor, indulging in luxury and arrogance, and enjoying a carefree lifestyle. <br/>Considering the funds involved and the status of the actors participating, the opening ceremony of 《Guiyuan Tower》 was quite modest. The venue wasn’t very large, no media were invited, and the entire process took no more than an hour and a half, which surprised almost everyone. However, the subsequent banquet wasn’t skimped on and was still included.<br/>The location of the banquet, though, was unexpected for Shen Kong.<br/>If he thought about it carefully, he actually had quite an enigmatic connection with this place——<br/>Shen Kong looked up at the simple yet exquisite letters against the dark background and read them out softly: <br/>Puzzel.<br/>A fellow actor walked up beside him and overheard Shen Kong’s murmur, looking a bit surprised:<br/>“You don’t know this place?”<br/>Shen Kong snapped back to his senses and habitually put on Meng Mingxuan’s approachable smile: “It seems familiar, but I can’t remember where I’ve heard of it.” <br/>The actor gave him a peculiar look, then said:<br/>“This was opened by one of our investors after returning to the country. It’s been extremely popular lately. You need a certain status and background to book a spot here. Thanks to his good relationship with Director Pei, he reserved an entire floor for us.”<br/>Shen Kong was taken aback, a strange premonition rising within him. He tentatively asked:<br/>“And this investor is…?” <br/>The other person responded as if it were obvious, “Of course, it’s President Han.”<br/>Shen Kong narrowed his eyes slightly, his amber pupils flickering with an obscure light in the night. His expression shifted subtly in the changing light, becoming particularly inscrutable.<br/>It all seemed to make sense now.<br/>Meeting Han Li in that club during high school wasn’t a coincidence. Coupled with what Cheng Chen’s gambling-addicted father had said, the casino owner sent people after him because they thought he had a connection with the boss behind Puzzel. Shen Kong had dismissed Cheng Zekang’s words as nonsense at the time. It wasn’t until now that he seriously considered their meaning and recalled… just a few days before going to the club, he had saved Han Li from a group of thugs in the rain. <br/>That must have been when he was noticed.<br/>Shen Kong subtly rubbed his fingertip, a dark coldness flashing in his lowered eyes.<br/><br/>It seemed that little brat had hidden quite a few things from him back then. His acting was pretty good—almost as good as professionals.<br/>He had been careless. He overlooked the butterfly effect that his changes to the plot at the first key point could cause, which led him to make incorrect assumptions about the plot at the second key point. <br/>Shen Kong took a deep breath and followed the others who filed in through the open door.<br/>The familiar minimalist decor and geometric, hard-edged design seemed even more uninviting under the cool lighting, yet they held a strange allure. The overall style was more cohesive and unique compared to eight years ago, further confirming Shen Kong’s earlier suspicions.<br/>It now seemed that to understand how far the current plot had deviated, he needed to start considering events from eight years ago. He couldn’t simply rely on the suggested storyline given by the system for reverse deduction—he had chosen the simplest and easiest method at the last key point, and now he felt the sting of his mistake.<br/>Shen Kong calmly watched the numbers on the small screen in the elevator slowly rise, feeling a rare sense of excitement and passion. <br/>This job was becoming more and more interesting.<br/>He had always enjoyed challenges. The thrill and heartbeat that came from walking on the edge of danger were the true signs that he was alive. Difficult, complex, insurmountable, and unconquerable tasks always sparked his curiosity and competitive spirit.<br/>He originally thought Han Li was an open book, with some passages unclear but overall uninteresting.<br/>But now everything has changed. <br/>Shen Kong slowly curled and stretched his fingers, feeling the blood pump from his heart to his cold fingertips. Under his eyelashes, his eyes shone with genuine excitement.<br/>His interest in this target was now sincere, not driven by the system’s task or the mission attached to his temporary identity——He was deeply curious about the true nature hidden beneath the facade of a business prodigy and obedient student.<br/>Maintaining such a facade from a young age was truly impressive.<br/>Shen Kong’s lips curled slightly in admiration. With an unchanged expression, he followed the others out of the elevator and into the banquet hall that had been reserved for them. <br/>Several veteran actors, along with the investors, director, and producer, sat at the head of the table. The rest of the seating was less formal. Shen Kong chose a spot that wasn’t too out of the way but allowed him to have a clear view of most of the venue. He sat down and quietly observed the happenings with a cold eye.<br/>Han Li arrived some time after everyone had taken their seats.<br/>As time passed, the atmosphere grew livelier. Though Han Li wore a polite social smile, he seemed enveloped by a strange sense of distance. His somber eyes and brows carried a sternness that commanded respect without anger. Apart from Pei Xiuran, few dared to approach him proactively.<br/>He just held a glass of wine, sipping it absentmindedly. <br/>Despite the gentle smile on his face, he remained out of sync with the lively atmosphere of the room. His dark eyes projected an aloofness that kept people at bay.<br/>Shen Kong quietly watched Han Li from a distance, like a beast lurking in the shadows, waiting patiently, observing, seeking out every small movement, analyzing and scrutinizing, and searching for possible flaws.<br/>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>At that moment, Han Li’s eyelids lifted slightly, his dark eyes moving precisely to look directly at Shen Kong.<br/>Their gazes met in midair. <br/>The author has something to say: Ha, let’s see you call my chapters short again</div>
