    <div class='content'>After nearly three hours on the bus, they finally arrived at their destination.<br/>The guests got off the bus and couldn’t help but exclaim in amazement. <br/>In front of them was a dense and thriving primordial forest.<br/>The thick tree trunks twisted with gnarled roots, some so large that it would take several people to encircle them. The dense branches and leaves wove together overhead, forming a massive canopy like a verdant parasol. There was a wild and untamed beauty in their uninhibited growth, competing for air and water and ultimately intertwining into an inseparable whole. Countless long vines and aerial roots dangled from above, creating a dense, impenetrable web.
<br/><br/>This was a pure, wild charm, completely different from the city.<br/>Shen Kong was the last to get off the bus. His fingers slightly tightened on the metal door frame. His steps instinctively paused. <br/>He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.

<br/>The fresh air filled his nostrils, mingling with the scent of soil and decaying leaves, so familiar as if it were etched into his bones and genes.<br/>Shen Kong adjusted the strap of his backpack, then leapt down the bus steps. The hard soles of his boots sank into the soft humus, with each step feeling like he was treading on his memories.<br/>He looked up at the dense branches and leaves overhead, his gaze piercing through the gaps to the clear sky beyond, a strange expression flashing in his eyes.

 <br/>At that moment, a sound not far ahead interrupted Shen Kong’s contemplation.<br/>It turned out that the instructor was telling everyone to start hiking.<br/>Their goal this time was not only to survive for seven days in the Yunwu Mountains but also to traverse this primordial forest within those seven days.

<br/>The production team had placed maps in each of their backpacks, marking the route for this expedition. Shen Kong had reviewed and compared the maps the previous night. This forest was vast, but the route chosen by the production team was the shortest and least dangerous one. Essentially, they had made a narrow and short cut from the outer edge of the forest. Although it was described as “traversing the primordial forest,” it was merely a gimmick—they were just skirting the forest’s edge. <br/>Even so, the daily distance they needed to cover was considerable—especially for these celebrities who were not accustomed to such activity.<br/>Shen Kong walked at the rear of the group, stepping forward one foot deep and one foot shallow.<br/>The forest ahead was dark and deep, seemingly representing an unknown realm. The path they were traveling was not smooth. Since they were heading into the Tunwu Zountains, they were constantly climbing. Additionally, the ground was covered with meters-thick humus and massive, sprawling tree roots. This was a challenge for everyone without professional training, so the entire group’s pace was not very fast.<br/>Shen Kong walked second to last in the group. <br/>He neither hurried forward nor lagged behind, but maintained this inconspicuous position. Just behind him was Ran Wan, who seemed to have the weakest stamina in the group. She had originally been in the third position but had gradually fallen to the very end.<br/>Her fair and delicate face had smudges of dirt. Her cheeks were also flushed from exertion, but she continued to persevere, gritting her teeth.<br/>The survival instructor, who was at the back to ensure no one fell behind, approached her and quietly inquired about her condition.<br/>Ran Wan gritted her teeth, showed a smile, and said breathlessly: <br/>“I’m fine. I can keep going.”<br/>Shen Kong glanced at her and suddenly had an idea.<br/>Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>He slowed his pace to walk alongside the instructor and tugged at his sleeve, his face showing a pitiful expression as he said:<br/>“Instructor, my foot hurts. When can we rest?” <br/>The instructor looked at him in surprise, his brow furrowing tightly. “It’s not even eleven o’clock yet, and we’ve only been walking for an hour and a half. How can you be complaining already? Ran Wan, a girl, can keep going. How can you, a grown man, be so incapable of enduring hardship?”<br/>Meng Mingxuan continued to pester, “I think I twisted my ankle when I stepped over that tree root. It really hurts. Instructor, can you just tell me when we can rest?”<br/>The instructor, clearly exasperated by his persistence, replied, “We’ll reach the river after a few more kilometers. We’ll set up camp there and have lunch.”<br/>Satisfied, Shen Kong stopped asking questions. But as he turned to leave, the instructor pulled him back. <br/>“Wait, didn’t you say you twisted your ankle? This could be serious. Take off your shoe and let me check. I need to make sure you’re not at risk for the rest of the hike.”<br/>Shen Kong: “……”<br/>If I had known, I would have made up a different excuse.<br/>But then he reconsidered: Isn’t this even better? <br/>To slow down the group by lying about twisting his ankle—what a perfect plan.<br/>So, he calmly found a stone to sit down on, took off his right boot, and let the instructor examine his ankle.<br/>Because of this unexpected incident, the whole group had to stop and wait. Sure enough, two minutes later, the instructor stood up, frowning, and said, “Your ankle is fine. Are you sure you twisted it?”<br/>Meng Mingxuan hesitated, speechless. <br/>The other five celebrities all looked at him with displeasure. Even Duan Mingcheng, the most composed among them, showed a rare hint of annoyance.<br/>At that moment, Shen Kong caught a glimpse of something unusual out of the corner of his eye——<br/>Ran Wan, exhausted, had raised her hand to rest on a nearby tree trunk. A large brown snake coiled on the thick branch was preparing to strike, its body slowly tightening. Its sharp, triangular head lifted. Its body displayed a deadly, intricate pattern of spots. These markings distinguished it from non-venomous snakes and allowed it to blend perfectly into its surroundings. It almost merged with the brown withered tree trunk it coiled around, making it nearly invisible to other predators.<br/>Especially since everyone’s attention was focused on him. <br/>Even the two survival instructors were paying attention to him, the supposed twisted-ankle patient.<br/>——The snake’s neck arched and its mouth opened, revealing sharp fangs.<br/>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>In a split second, Shen Kong acted without thinking. He flipped his wrist, grabbed the small knife he always kept at hand, and expertly and swiftly threw it at the venomous snake.<br/>A flash of silver light. <br/>The military knife whizzed past Ran Wan’s cheek and embedded deeply into the wooden stake with a “thud.”<br/>The wind from the knife’s passage lifted the hair beside Ran Wan’s cheek. She looked blank for a few seconds before finally screaming, “Aaaahhh—!”<br/>Everyone was stunned, standing frozen and staring in shock at what had just happened.<br/>Only the instructor reacted quickly. He stood up and hurriedly ran to Ran Wan’s side. Upon seeing what was behind her, he couldn’t help but pause for a moment. <br/>He finally saw the large snake coiled around the branch next to Ran Wan. Its thick, mottled body looked particularly terrifying in the light.<br/>The small knife was embedded precisely at the snake’s vital spot, not a fraction off, piercing through the snake completely and pinning it firmly to the tree trunk. The handle of the knife was still trembling slightly from the force.<br/>The author has something to say:<br/>Shen Kong: “……” <br/>How do I salvage my carefully crafted persona?
