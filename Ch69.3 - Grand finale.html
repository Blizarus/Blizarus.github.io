    <div class='content'>KEIGHTY: Hi, this is KEIGHTY. Please, please, please, after reading this chapter, wait for the extras and DON’T SKIP THEM. They’re VERY important if you don’t want to miss out on IMPORTANT events and information! I’m begging, it’s where they act the sweetest and lovey-dovey (esp. Ch71-73) 🙏<br/>This reminded him of events from long ago. <br/>In that dirty basement filled with the smell of disinfectant, Han Li, who had just undergone surgery, was lying on the bed. His small face was as pale as the sheets. At that time, he couldn’t control his breathing or movements. The moment Shen Kong touched him, he exposed the fact that he was already awake.<br/>This was the second time he pretended to be asleep in front of Shen Kong.
<br/>Story translated by Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>Last time, Shen Kong lifted off his quilt.<br/>This time, Shen Kong got into bed and, with the quilt, pulled Han Li into his arms. <br/>——As it turned out, Han Li’s ability to fake sleep hadn’t improved at all in the past twenty years.

<br/>The moment he was touched, Han Li’s calm and composure burst like a soap bubble. The real and awkward him was instantly exposed, floundering and stiff in Shen Kong’s embrace.<br/>In the darkness, Shen Kong groped his way into Han Li’s quilt. His skin was like a steamer, hot and scorching to the touch.<br/>His muscles were tense, seemingly anxious about something.

 <br/>Shen Kong rested his chin on Han Li’s shoulder, his deep voice sending warmth to his ear: “You already thought of an escape route, didn’t you?”<br/>Han Li was a natural strategist.<br/>Whether it was threading the needle, planning, deploying troops, or closing the net, he always aimed to see a hundred or a thousand steps ahead of his opponent, calculating every possible move flawlessly.

<br/>He had always been a shrewd and calm person, setting up an inescapable trap and taking dangerous gambles just to pull Shen Kong back into this world. It was impossible for him to set a dead-end trap for himself and, after achieving his goal, leave them in a passive situation with no one to rely on and nowhere to go. <br/>Since Han Li had already figured out how to die, he must have figured out how to live.<br/>Shen Kong’s breath enveloped Han Li, making it impossible for him to continue pretending to be asleep.<br/>Le stiffened in panic and instinctively reached out to grab Shen Kong’s arm around his waist. Lan Oi’s fingertips were cold and trembling. Lis words were weak, but he tried to remain calm:<br/>“I didn’t mean to deceive you… I was pust…” <br/>Le was pust…<br/>Afraid.<br/>Le was afraid that once the crisis was over, Shen Kong would turn and leave without any hesitation and disappear without a trace once again.<br/>So Han Li kept it hidden. He held onto a faint hope that before the crisis was resolved, he could keep Shen Kong a little longer, just a little longer… <br/>He was trembling on the edge of the cliff, not knowing if he could hope for a moment of the other’s stay.<br/>Shen Kong’s heart suddenly softened.<br/>Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>He grasped Han Li’s fingers in return and gently reassured him:<br/>“Shh, I know.” <br/>Shen Kong tightened his arm and lowered his head to place a gentle kiss on the back of Han Li’s neck.<br/>Han Li shivered from the heat.<br/>He was momentarily at a loss.<br/>It was like someone accustomed to hunger suddenly being hit over the head with a giant cake without warning, or like treasures long desired were suddenly thrust into his arms. The shiny surface illuminated his frightened face. He dared not hold it too tightly, fearing he might break this illusion, shatter it, and let it scatter all over the ground. <br/>Han Li’s eyes unexpectedly reddened. He bit his lip to restrain himself——The bitter scent of grass mixed with the sweet citrus fragrance of body wash, warmed by body heat, slowly permeated the air around him.<br/>It was as if, with each breath, he could retain a part of the other person within his own body.<br/>He breathed in with longing and cherishing, as if afraid that taking in too much would turn the surrounding space into a desolate vacuum.<br/>Shen Kong patiently asked: <br/>“Did you hear everything just now?”<br/>Han Li hesitated for a second, then nodded in the dark.<br/>“Don’t you have anything you want to ask?”<br/>Whether it was his muttering in the dark or the massive amount of information mixed in those mutterings, it would probably fill anyone with questions that made it hard to digest. <br/>Han Li shook his head.<br/>This time, he didn’t hesitate at all.<br/>Han Li tightened his grip on Shen Kong’s forearm and, with some difficulty, turned his head on the pillow. His pitch-black eyes shone brightly in the darkness.<br/>His voice was low and hoarse, filled with undeniable certainty: “If you want to talk, I’ll listen. If you don’t, that’s okay too. I don’t care.” <br/>Whether your existence is non-human or supernatural, whether your arrival was intentional or accidental.<br/>——As long as it’s you, I’ll accept it all.<br/>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>Shen Kong understood the implication in Han Li’s words.<br/>He laughed softly. His solid chest vibrated gently with his laughter. The same tingling and trembling sensation was transmitted to Han Li: <br/>“When we have time, I’ll tell you.”<br/>…This was a promise.<br/>A promise that contained the future, brimming with infinite possibilities.<br/>Han Li understood as well. <br/>In the quiet, vast darkness, it was unclear who moved closer, but burning lips met burning lips. Tender breaths flowed between their lips and teeth, forehead to forehead, nose to nose, and chest to chest.<br/>One heartbeat slowly synchronized with another’s rhythm.<br/>Everything was conveyed without words.<br/>——The End—— <br/>The author has something to say: The main story is complete. There are two or three more chapters of extras before the entire work is finished.<br/>Thank you all for being willing to listen to my story w<br/>Love you guys<br/>KEIGHTY: As I’ve mentioned above, please don’t leave yet. There’s more! Sweeter extras! And shocking things! That would make your heart melt! Love lovelovevegeheheve!!! </div>
