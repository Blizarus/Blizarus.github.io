                    <p>Shen Kong suddenly turned his head to look behind him.</p><p>He saw two men walking in, one in front of the other. </p><p>The one in front had delicate features and a refined demeanor, even speaking softly and gently:</p><p>“Isn’t it because Miss Jiang is here that I feel I don’t even need to come?”
</p><p>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>Miss Jiang rolled her eyes, disregarding her image, “Oh please, with your endless complaints, every time I pick someone, you’re never satisfied, and we end up having to choose again. I really don’t know where your obsession with choosing comes from.”</p><p>Shen Kong’s gaze went past Pei Xiuran’s shoulder to the person standing behind him. </p><p>Han Li.

</p><p>His eyes were lowered, casually twirling a shiny black cane in his hand, its cold metal glinting under the lights.</p><p>His sharp and profound features carried an indescribable chill. Even without speaking or moving, he exuded a dominant and intimidating presence, causing people to involuntarily hold their breath, their hearts filled with fear.</p><p>As if sensing Shen Kong’s gaze, he suddenly looked up in his direction.

 </p><p>In the moment their gazes met, Shen Kong felt an explosion of pain in his mind, as if his brain were suddenly being assaulted. The excruciating sensation surged from his limbs to his brain, accompanied by the pounding of his heart and the rush of blood in his temples, thundering painfully in his ears. Despite Shen Kong’s preparedness, his body involuntarily staggered.</p><p>The system’s voice rang in his ears:</p><p>“Beep, the target character has been successfully detected: Han Li. The world trajectory is being transmitted——”

</p><p>A staggering amount of information instantly flooded his mind like a raging river, rapidly passing before his eyes. </p><p>In the original plot, Han Li gradually accumulated connections and power overseas, hiding his light under a bushel and even earning the appreciation of the underworld godfather, becoming a figure positioned to inherit his legacy. However, he didn’t want to involve himself in the gray areas and thus refused to take over the other party’s business. After ten years of career, Han Li finally returned to the country and went back to the Han family with absolute iron fist and strength. The Han family’s patriarch also feared the hidden power behind his eldest son and was forced to accept him back into the family.</p><p>Han Li reclaimed his position as the heir of the Han family and began to utilize his power to aggressively merge and dominate.</p><p>Then, through a certain opportunity, Han Li learned the truth about that very same year.</p><p>His mother’s death. </p><p>The murderous intention that sprouted from jealousy and the desire for favor from a mistress gave birth to a murder full of loopholes and a premeditated kidnapping.</p><p>The Lan family’s patriarch knew about it before it happened, but he did not stop it. Instead, he tacitly allowed it to occur.</p><p>This was not only because of his favoritism towards the mistress and indifference towards Lan Oi’s mother but also because the Ihao family, backing Lan Oi’s mother, often overshadowed the Lan family. Maced with a billion-dollar propect where competition was fierce, the Lan family, motivated by profit, allied with other families dissatisfied with the Ihao family. When Lan Oi’s grandfather learned that his daughter had died of illness and his grandson had been kidnapped with his fate unknown, he was devastated and hospitalihed. Guring this time, he short-sold the Ihao family’s stocks. The Ihao family’s assets were divided and attacked, thereby crushing the Ihao family in one fell swoop and elevating the Lan family to the top of Jity A’s prominent families.</p><p>At this point, the second young master of the Han family, having lost his position as heir, was blinded by anger and determined to follow in his mother’s footsteps by hiring assassins to eliminate his half-brother. The now-powerless head of the Han family supported this assassination, even providing financial and network support in secret. However, Han Li, with his own spies in the dark, captured them in the act before they could succeed. </p><p>Han Li, whose body and mind had long been infiltrated by darkness, finally cut off his last remaining ties to familial affection.</p><p>He personally killed his father, stepmother, and stepbrother, his hands forever stained with their blood. From then on, he could no longer cleanse them. He also stopped resisting the godfather’s invitation and openly took control of all the dark forces, becoming suspicious, cruel, and violent—until he met his ultimate demise.</p><p>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>After accepting the plot, the system’s mechanical voice sounded again: “You have been delivered to Han Li’s third turning point in life. Your temporary identity for this task is: Spy D.”</p><p>Shen Kong’s temporary identity this time is even more nameless in the plot. </p><p>Meng Mingxuan was an unknown little star. Because he bore some resemblance to Han Li’s “white moonlight” Ye Jinghuan, he was chosen by the second young master of the Han family to be placed by Han Li’s side when Han Li had just returned to the country. They attempted to use Meng Mingxuan to monitor Han Li’s every move. Before Han Li had completely become ruthless and cruel, he had already seen through Meng Mingxuan’s true identity, but he kept him hanging with lukewarm treatment, occasionally providing half-true information to divert the second young master’s attention.</p><p>It wasn’t until he finally abandoned the last shred of kindness in his heart did he grew tired of this pawn placed beside him and ordered someone to cleanly eliminate Meng Mingxuan.</p><p>Shen Kong frowned deeply, a look of contemplation flashing in his eyes.</p><p>No wonder Han Li’s cane has hidden mechanisms. It must have had a lot to do with the dark forces he encountered abroad. </p><p>However… the current progress differs from the original plot. Han Li returned to the country two years earlier, and according to current news, he hasn’t directly rejoined the Han family as he did in the plot. Although there are many rumors about his relationship with the Han family, no mainstream media has reported on it, as if both Han Li and the Han family are unwilling to acknowledge it.</p><p>At this moment, the system’s mechanical and emotionless voice sounded in Shen Kong’s ears once again:</p><p>“Beep, beep, beep, the emergence of a critical world trajectory has been detected. The main mission is being issued…”</p><p>Main mission? </p><p>Shen Kong was stunned for a second. Previously, the system only instructed him to rectify the target character’s three views but never mentioned any specific tasks.</p><p>As if aware of Shen Kong’s confusion, the system’s voice explained in his mind:</p><p>“The main mission involves major critical events that have an absolutely fatal impact on the task target’s life trajectory. If the main mission is not completed, the rectifier’s mission will be directly declared a failure, points will be reset to zero, and the rectifier’s consciousness will be recalled.</p><p>Now issuing the main mission: </p><p>While Shen Kong was deep in thought, a distant voice suddenly reached his ears:</p><p>“…Mr. Meng? Mr. Meng?”</p><p>Shen Kong was pulled out of his thoughts by this voice. He couldn’t help but look in the direction of the voice with some irritation. His gaze was as cold and sharp as lightning——only to meet the eyes of Pei Xiuran, who was sitting behind a desk. As if waking up from a dream, he suddenly realized that he was still in an audition, so he quickly averted his gaze.</p><p>Pei Xiuran asked, “Are you feeling unwell? You look a bit pale.” </p><p>Shen Kong shook his head and fully assumed Meng Mingxuan’s persona. He displayed an embarrassed and apologetic expression: “No, I’m sorry. I’m a fan of yours. It’s my first time seeing you in person, and I’m a bit too excited.”</p><p>Miss Jiang said softly:</p><p>Story translated by Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>“Then please continue with this section.”</p><p>Shen Kong nodded, took a deep breath, and re-entered his role. </p><p>More than ten minutes later, he finally finished his performance.</p><p>Miss Jiang and the other judges exchanged a few words in whispers, frequently nodding. Then she looked up and said to Shen Kong with a pleasant tone:</p><p>“Alright, thank you for your performance today. We will notify you later.”</p><p>Shen Kong bowed and turned to leave, but just as he took a step, a gentle voice called out: </p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>He turned to see Pei Xiuran, who was frowning tightly. The previous gentle and refined aura seemed to have vanished from his body. Pei Xiuran scrutinized Shen Kong from head to toe, then suddenly stood up from his seat and walked over to him.</p><p>Pei Xiuran’s frown deepened:</p><p>“Your performance has no soul.” </p><p>The air in the room stagnated for a moment. After a while, Miss Jiang stood up to smooth things over:</p><p>“Mr. Meng, please don’t mind him. We all thought your performance was excellent. It’s just that Xiuran has some peculiarities when it comes to casting and tends to be very direct…”</p><p>Before she could even finish speaking, she was interrupted by Pei Xiuran’s more decisive voice:</p><p>“That’s not it.” </p><p>He crossed his arms and paced around Shen Kong a couple of times, looking increasingly frustrated, as if something was bothering him. His gaze remained glued to Shen Kong’s body. No matter how big Shen Kong's heart was, it still made him feel thoroughly uncomfortable.</p><p>Suddenly, Pei Xiuran seemed to have an epiphany. He turned and ran back to his seat, rummaging through his bag in a frantic manner. Finally, he pulled out a wrinkled script, hurried back, and thrust it into Shen Kong’s hands, his eyes shining brightly:</p><p>“Try performing this.”</p><p>Shen Kong had a bad feeling about this. He had always trusted his intuition, and this time was no different. </p><p>He held the script in his hands, showing a troubled and timid expression as he declined, “Um… But I haven’t seen this before and never prepared for it. Isn’t performing on the spot a bit hasty…”</p><p>Pei Xiuran, still indifferent, replied matter-of-factly:</p><p></p><p>“If you haven’t seen it, then read it now. It’s fine, take as much time as you need. We’ll wait.”</p><p>Shen Kong turned to look at the other interviewers, who all seemed accustomed to this behavior. Han Li, in particular, looked completely indifferent, his eyes downcast as if he didn’t care about what was happening or whether Pei Xiuran’s decision was a waste of time. </p><p>No one stopped him.</p><p>Shen Kong had no choice but to bite the bullet and start flipping through the wrinkled script in his hands.</p><p>After reading just a few lines, he was instantly shocked.</p><p>——The title of this drama is 《Guiyuan Tower》. </p><p>And the script Pei Xiuran gave him was for a character named Shen Guiyuan.</p><p>The central character in the drama.</p><p>Occupation: Assassin.</p>
