                    <p>Shen Kong, who had been waiting for his name to be called as soon as Pei Xiuran shouted stop, didn’t hear the familiar call for a long time. He couldn’t help but be a little surprised.</p><p>He grabbed a bottle of soda from the side of the set and leisurely walked to his seat. </p><p>Although the costume he was wearing was not too heavy, it was still an ancient-style robe with wide sleeves. The soft and thick fabric wrapped tightly around him, making it quite stifling in the current weather conditions.</p><p>Shen Kong pressed the ice-cold soda bottle against his face. The cool, moist metal surface significantly lowered the heat on his cheeks.
</p><p>Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>The noisy and chaotic sounds of the set merged into a torrent, enveloping the entire area like a viscous substance that entangled everyone within it.</p><p>Shen Kong closed his eyes and slowly exhaled. </p><p>In fact, the continuous working hours under Pei Xiuran didn’t bother him too much. After all, in his previous world, he had undergone more rigorous and grueling training. The workload of filming on set was hardly a challenge for him. What he found difficult was the lack of freedom after joining the crew. He didn’t have many scenes, so he thought he would be able to leave the crew quickly. However, Pei Xiuran repeatedly and indefinitely extended his filming time and occupied all his rest time with various classes. Moreover, the remaining fragmented time was tightly controlled by his manager and assistant.

</p><p>Being a public figure was truly difficult.</p><p>Especially for someone like Shen Kong who was used to operating in the shadows, living under the high-intensity spotlight was intolerable.</p><p>However, to maintain the persona of this temporary identity and avoid giving Han Li, who was already suspicious, any substantial evidence, he had no choice but to endure it.

 </p><p>This main task hung over his head like the precarious Sword of Damocles, ready to fall at any moment. Especially now that the main storyline has almost completely deviated, the original timeline is no longer a reliable reference. He had no idea when Han Li planned to act, making it impossible to prevent it. His original plan to get close to Han Li through “being kept” had basically fallen apart—after all, he was now stuck in the crew every day, with no chance to approach Han Li.

</p><p>Moreover… Shen Kong couldn’t shake the feeling that Han Li seemed to be avoiding him lately? </p><p>There had been no news for so many days, yet his resources and benefits continued to be sent to the crew one after another. Shen Kong began to wonder if “being kept” in this world had a different meaning—perhaps it actually meant unconditional support?</p><p>In any case, leaving the crew became his top priority.</p><p>Whether to hide his true abilities or not was no longer important. What mattered was that he had to escape the current state of strict control. After all, the production cycle of this drama was very long, especially under Pei Xiuran’s obsessive perfectionism. From post-production editing to the official release, it could take even longer——Even if Shen Kong’s mission progress was going smoothly, he would likely be long gone by then.</p><p>Shen Kong opened his eyes and pulled the tab on the soda bottle. The damp metal surface wetted his palm. </p><p>He raised his head and took a couple of sips. The liquid inside was still ice-cold. It slid down his throat and into his stomach, briefly alleviating the stifling heat on the set.</p><p>Aust then, an ear-piercing voice cut through the noisy background, seemingly aimed directly at his ears.</p><p>“Isn’t it something? Laving to reshoot so many times because of him. After all, it’s the level of a web series. Sven if he got into the crew through connections, he still can’t meet the director’s standards. Le really has no self-awareness.”</p><p>The person they were talking about paused and looked in the direction of the voice. </p><p>Not far away, a few supporting actors with relatively minor roles were chatting. They would occasionally glance in Shen Kong’s direction with faint disdain in their expressions. Shen Kong recognized a few of their faces. Though not very famous, they were in a better position than Meng Mingxuan, who was almost unknown before joining the crew. Many of these actors had lowered their standards to play minor roles with few appearances because the popularity of 《Guiyuan Tower》 was so high. Even a small role could bring some traffic benefits.</p><p>Shen Kong could understand.</p><p></p><p>After all, an unknown web series actor got the coveted role, likely through questionable means. He even repeatedly caused retakes and slowed down the entire crew’s progress. It was natural to harbor some resentment. Shen Kong even shared this sentiment—had he known there would be so many issues after joining the crew, he probably wouldn’t have even attended the audition. Meeting opportunities could be created, but losing time could never be regained.</p><p>He cast a casual glance over the group, then indifferently looked away. </p><p>The group of actors was intentionally provoking Shen Kong and deliberately letting him hear their conversation. However, they hadn’t expected his indifferent reaction, like hitting a pillow with their fists. It left their anger without an outlet, stuck in their throats uncomfortably. One of them raised their voice and sarcastically mocked:</p><p>“But why would he care about that? After all, he only needs to sweet-talk his sugar daddy to get whatever he wants…”</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, another familiar voice interrupted, with a pretentious and stern tone that was hypocritically condescending:</p><p>“What are you talking about? Don’t spread unfounded rumors. What if someone else hears you?” </p><p>Shen Kong slightly turned his face to see Qi Yi approaching from behind him, a formal smile on his handsome face:</p><p>“Mingxuan, don’t take their words to heart. They don’t mean any harm.”</p><p>He sifted through the information provided by the system about the original host and Qi Yi’s past. It turned out that Meng Mingxuan and Qi Yi had once signed with the same company. The two had clashed back then—Qi Yi was jealous of Meng Mingxuan’s looks, while Meng Mingxuan despised Qi Yi’s hypocrisy. This rift deepened over time. Later, Qi Yi snatched resources that originally belonged to Meng Mingxuan, gaining some popularity and eventually leaving the small company. Meng Mingxuan was no saint either; he found an opportunity to severely undermine Qi Yi and solidify their enmity.</p><p>The recent rumors on set clearly showed signs of being deliberately stirred up. </p><p>However, Shen Kong didn’t care about others’ gossip and was even less interested in the original host’s past conflicts with others.</p><p>He gave Qi Yi a cold nod and then looked away.</p><p>This almost dismissive attitude made Qi Yi’s temple twitch involuntarily. A flicker of anger flashed obscurely in his eyes.</p><p>His deep-seated loathing for Meng Mingxuan stemmed from a mix of jealousy when they first entered the industry and resentment from being framed later. This ultimately settled into a complex and dark mire. Even as Qi Yi gradually gained exposure and fame, he remained fixated on his contemporary, Meng Mingxuan——In fact, Meng Mingxuan’s decline in later years was partly due to Qi Yi’s machinations. So when Qi Yi saw Meng Mingxuan at the audition, he couldn’t maintain his composure. But he hadn’t expected Meng Mingxuan to secure the role of Shen Guiyuan, directly overshadowing him in the drama. </p><p>Qi Yi couldn’t swallow this humiliation and used all his connections to investigate.</p><p>He unexpectedly discovered that Meng Mingxuan had latched onto President Han, a high-profile backer. This explained the continuous flow of resources and opportunities that made Qi Yi extremely envious.</p><p>However, it was said that President Han wasn’t serious about Meng Mingxuan and was treating him merely as a plaything.</p><p>Seeing the resemblance between Meng Mingxuan and a certain popular star, a bold idea couldn’t help but surface in Qi Yi’s mind. His expression became even more disdainful. </p><p>The smile on his face widened as he called out to Shen Kong, who was clutching a script and standing up, ready to walk toward the director:</p><p>“By the way, did you hear that Ye Jinghuan will be joining the crew in a few days?”</p><p>Story translated by Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>Shen Kong paused and turned to look at him. “Hmm?”</p><p>Seeing that the other party finally looked at him directly, a hint of satisfaction flashed in Qi Yi’s eyes. He added, “The actor for the second male lead had an accident and needs to be replaced. Director Pei chose Ye Jinghuan. He’s a senior with great acting skills and character. We can learn a lot from him.” </p><p>He originally thought his words would provoke the other party, but to his surprise, Shen Kong didn’t even raise an eyebrow. He simply replied with an indifferent “Oh,” then turned and walked away.</p><p>——He was just a substitute. What’s with that attitude?</p><p>Qi Yi’s temper flared instantly. He instinctively reached out to grab the wide sleeve of Shen Kong’s robe. But before his fingers could touch the hem, Shen Kong, as if having eyes on the back of his head, suddenly sidestepped, causing Qi Yi to grab at the air.</p><p>Qi Yi couldn’t help but feel furious and humiliated. Before he could say anything, the man in front of him turned slightly and glanced back coldly. Under the overly bright set lights, Shen Kong’s amber eyes appeared almost transparent. Just one moment of that piercing gaze made Qi Yi feel a chill and freeze in place. </p><p>Shen Kong used his fingers to adjust his sleeves, the contrast making his slender fingers appear even more white and jade-like against the dark fabric. He symbolically dusted off his robe and suddenly smiled:</p><p>“It’s indeed a bit dirty. Thanks.”</p><p>With that, he casually lowered his hand and walked towards the set.</p><p>The preparations for the next scene were in full swing. The prop masters, cameramen, and makeup artists hurried around the set, but Qi Yi stood frozen in place as if under a spell. Despite the stifling heat, which felt like the peak of summer, he felt as if he had fallen into an icy abyss. His mind kept replaying that brief moment over and over again. </p><p>Those inhuman eyes were sweeping over him with indifference and coldness, looking down at him as if he were a lifeless object.</p><p>That visceral, instinctual fear made Qi Yi’s scalp tingle. He broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>Shen Kong, on the other hand, continued to shoot the next scene as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Surprisingly, Pei Xiuran was exceptionally easygoing during the subsequent shoots. Several scenes were completed in a single take, boosting the morale of the entire crew and accelerating their progress. Qi Yi, however, was distracted and performed so poorly that Pei Xiuran postponed his scenes to the next day. </p><p>Soon, it was time to wrap up. Shen Kong stepped off the set, took the handkerchief his assistant handed him, wiped his face, and headed to the dressing room.</p><p>The background noise was filled with the sounds of equipment rolling and clashing and the chatter of the busy crew.</p><p>Shen Kong lifted his head and casually glanced into the distance, his gaze inadvertently fixing on the shadows cast by the beams at the edge of the set.</p><p>He couldn’t help but be slightly startled. </p><p>A tall man stood in the darkness, his black suit almost blending into the shadows. His facial features were obscured by the darkness, with only the faint, flickering glow of a red cigarette tip visible. In the light, the man’s slender, pale fingers could be seen loosely gripping a long cane.</p><p>…Han Li?</p><p></p><p>Why was he here?</p><p>And… how long had he been standing there? </p><p>Countless questions flooded Shen Kong’s mind, but the next second, his gaze rested on the cane Han Li was leaning on.</p><p>The pitch-black shaft of the cane shimmered faintly in the light, with pale wood grain winding around it like a snake. The tip of the cane gleamed with a metallic reflection.</p><p>This was the very cane that appeared in the airport photos and was suspected to secretly conceal a weapon.</p>
