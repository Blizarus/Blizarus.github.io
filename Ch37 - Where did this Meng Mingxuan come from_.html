    <div class='content'>KEIGHTY: Here’s an extra chapter special thanks to Oudie! 🎉 Thank you so much for the ko-fi! Enjoy reading 3VIEWS! 💐🫶<br/>Just as Shen Kong returned to his apartment, his phone received a call from an unknown number. <br/>He paused for a moment before answering the call. Tang-ge’s voice came through the receiver:<br/>“I heard about the audition today. You did well, very good. Our people will work on it within the company, then we should be able to secure your role. After that, we’ll arrange a few variety shows for you.”

His tone of surprise and gratitude starkly contrasted with his expressionless demeanor:

<br/>“Really?! Thank you, Tang-ge. I really don’t know how to thank you! I’ll definitely follow your instructions going forward…”<br/>After a few more exchanges, Tang-ge finally revealed the real purpose of his call:<br/>“I heard you had a private conversation with Han Li in the infirmary? What did you two talk about?”

 <br/>After Shen Kong recounted their conversation verbatim, the person on the other end of the line remained silent for a long time before finally speaking slowly:<br/>“You just said… he mentioned that in a couple of days, Pei Xiuran would personally apologize to you?”<br/>A hint of a smile flickered in Shen Kong’s eyes, but his voice remained full of feigned anxiety:

<br/>“Yes, speaking of that, President Han is really very approachable. I never expected him to propose such a thing…” <br/>There was another dead silence on the other end. After a long pause, Tang-ge asked somewhat hesitantly:<br/>“Then how did you respond? Did you agree?”<br/>“How could I? I was practically scared to death at that time. There’s no way I could agree to let someone of Director Pei’s status come and apologize to me.”<br/>Tang-ge’s voice sounded somewhat dazed, as if he still hadn’t fully grasped the situation yet: <br/>“…Yes, you did the right thing.”<br/>After a few more perfunctory exchanges, the other party absentmindedly ended the call.<br/>Looking at the now darkened screen of his phone, Shen Kong’s expression gradually grew indifferent. His lowered eyes were filled with calm. There are two reasons why he recounted the conversation in the infirmary to Tang-ge in such detail: firstly, since Tang-ge already claimed to know what happened during the audition, it indicated that someone among the interviewers was likely their informant, making it pointless to lie about such matters; secondly, he wanted to test the waters.<br/>Dased on Tang-ge’s reaction tonight, Lan Oi doesn’t seem like the type of person who would do such a thing. <br/>Shen Kong wasn’t narcissistic enough to believe that the persona he played could instantly change the attitude of someone he had never met.<br/>So, there were only two possibilities: either his resemblance to Te Ainghuan was working in his favor, or Lan Oi had discovered some clues.<br/>Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>Shen Kong sincerely hoped it was the first possibility.<br/>In any case, he needed to be even more cautious going forward. <br/>The unexpected incident during the audition today had really caught Shen Kong off guard, throwing him off balance——this couldn’t happen again.<br/>Pei Xiuran’s beast-like intuition was truly difficult to handle, and combined with his penchant for acting unpredictably, it was best to stay as far away from him as possible.<br/>Just as Shen Kong was thinking this, he heard a gentle knock at the door.<br/>“Knock, knock, knock.” <br/>The rhythmic knocking was soft and restrained, very polite.<br/>Shen Kong furrowed his brow——Meng Mingxuan’s social circle was very small, who could be visiting at this hour?<br/>He got up and walked to the door, looking through the peephole to see Pei Xiuran’s gentle and refined face.<br/>Shen Kong: “……” <br/>Damn.<br/>Whatever you don’t want to happen always seems to come true.<br/>He raised a hand to pinch the bridge of his nose and finally mustered the courage to open the door, his face instantly adopting the anxious expression that belonged to Meng Mingxuan——Shen Kong felt that after these past few days of practice, he had mastered the original owner’s demeanor to perfection.<br/>“D–Director Pei? Why are you here?” <br/>Pei Xiuran’s eyes lit up the moment he saw Shen Kong. Without waiting for an invitation, he stepped straight into the apartment.<br/>With his long limbs, he made the small apartment space feel even more cramped.<br/>Shen Kong’s brow twitched. Before he could say anything, Pei Xiuran sincerely gazed at him and slowly spoke:<br/>“Regarding this afternoon’s incident, a friend of mine made me deeply realize my mistake. So, I actually came to offer a sincere apology. I hope this incident won’t leave you with a bad impression of the production.” <br/>Pei Xiuran slightly furrowed his brow: “Actually, my friend was supposed to come with me later, but after returning to the office, I became more and more excited…”<br/>——Wait, excited?<br/>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>Shen Kong suddenly had a bad feeling.<br/>Pei Xiuran continued, “…so I came to find you ahead of time and, incidentally, discuss the script with you.” <br/>Obviously, discussing the script was the main purpose, and the apology was just in passing!<br/>Moreover, an internationally renowned director personally coming to the apartment of an 18th tier, struggling actor to discuss the script???<br/>​…What fucking kind of magical realism plot is this?<br/>For the first time, Shen Kong truly realized he was indeed in a novel—because a person who acts so unpredictably simply couldn’t exist in the real world! <br/>Noticing Shen Kong’s prolonged silence, Pei Xiuran took a step forward and asked, somewhat puzzled:<br/>“What’s wrong?”<br/>Shen Kong took a deep breath and smiled:<br/>“Nothing, nothing. I’m just so surprised… so surprised I’m speechless.” <br/>Given that Meng Mingxuan’s identity was arranged as a corporate spy beside Han Li, his employer also knew not to deliberately create opportunities for him to meet his target. This audition was merely to give him a chance to appear before Han Li. If he showed up too frequently, it would backfire. Other than his manager's significantly changed attitude, and getting him a few minor variety shows, Shen Kong’s schedule wasn’t much different from before.<br/>As the launch date for 《Guiyuan Tower》 approached, Pei Xiuran, who had been showing up uninvited since that day, also became busier and found it hard to make time to pester Shen Kong anymore——Shen Kong couldn’t help but breathe a huge sigh of relief.<br/>Dealing with this eccentric director was a real challenge. It took Shen Kong’s incredible self-control to resist the urge to punch Pei Xiuran in the face every time he saw him.<br/>During this time, Han Li had been almost entirely out of the public eye, except for occasional appearances in economic news. However, the value and reputation of his company were growing at a frightening pace. In just a few short months since his return to China, his name has become significant in the entire business world. Although Shen Kong wasn’t sure exactly what Han Li had been doing during this time, he could still sense the tremors shaking the entire industry. <br/>Time passed quietly and slowly, but beneath the surface, it seemed as if dark currents were churning, stirring up the current state of affairs.<br/>A month later, the official Weibo account for 《Guiyuan Tower》 began its promotions.<br/>With an ink-splashed background and an elegant, artistic nine-grid collage forming a chaotic war-torn scene, the post had no additional promotional text, just five simple words:<br/>“The Guiyuan Tower is open.” <br/>The entire internet went crazy about it.<br/>The novel “Guiyuan Tower” was highly renowned for its vast world-building, numerous tightly-knit plotlines, and rich three-dimensional characters. It had amassed a large, dedicated fanbase in the country. However, such a nationally beloved IP was also one of the hardest to adapt. Readers had already formed their own vivid imaginations of the story, and the challenge of the adaptation lay not only in translating the text to screen but also in replacing those imagined images with real actors. The resistance came not just from the adaptation difficulties but also from the potential backlash from fans.<br/><br/>And Pei Xiuran’s involvement as director added fuel to this craze.<br/>This was his first project since returning to the country and the first long-form drama he directed solo in his career. Known as a newly minted genius director, Pei Xiuran’s obsessive rigor in casting and filming was famous——this was the only comfort for the anxious fans as they waited. <br/>After posting that on Weibo, the official account continued to strike while the iron was hot, following the promotional routine of actor Weibo announcements paired with character costume photos, revealing the confirmed cast members one by one.<br/>From supporting roles to the leads, each announcement sparked intense discussions online, maintaining a high level of buzz.<br/>Until—<br/>The official announcement of Shen Guiyuan. <br/>This character actually doesn’t have a lot of screen time in the story, but he is the irreplaceable soul of the entire drama.<br/>In the book, everyone believes that the Guiyuan Tower doesn’t exist. It’s just a legend, a fairy tale in a chaotic world, an antidote for people to comfort and numb themselves amid the flames of war and strife, a fabricated glimmer of hope——<br/>As the world is in chaos, the Guiyuan Tower opens.<br/>And the Guiyuan Tower is said to choose the ruler of the world to restore peace and order. <br/>But the Guiyuan Tower does exist. However, it’s not a building, but an organization.<br/>Shen Guiyuan is not his real name, and no one knows what his real name is. This mystery only adds to his charm, attracting a large number of die-hard fans.<br/>Almost all the book fans felt extremely uneasy about the casting of this character. Some even claimed that no one in today’s entertainment industry could perfectly portray the role. However, there were also those who hoped to give Director Pei some trust and believed in his judgment.<br/>But the official announcement dashed all hopes. <br/>There was no costume photo, just a concept image—a broken sword thrust diagonally into a pitch-black abyss. The dried bloodstains looked like rust marks all over the black iron blade, and a tattered red ribbon wrapped around the hilt, fluttering in the harsh wind.<br/>There was no promotional text, just a tag to Meng Mingxuan’s Weibo.<br/>The internet instantly erupted in an uproar. Everyone was in shock——<br/>Where did this Meng Mingxuan come from? <br/>The author has something to say: I saw someone in the comments calling Han Li “Li Zi“!<br/>Such a cute nickname, I approve! Hahahahahaha<br/>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>(Han Li: ???)</div>
