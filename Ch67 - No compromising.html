    <div class='content'>Scaling the wall, prying the car, igniting and starting the engine—all done in one go.<br/>By the time Han Li realized what was happening, they had already driven several meters away from the monitored section of the road. The loud and chaotic sound of fire alarms and people’s voices were left far behind within a few breaths. They became faint whispers in the wind, as if blocked a thousand miles away. <br/>The neon lights outside the car window flashed by rapidly. The colorful lines and changing light patterns reflected on the glass like a beautiful dream.<br/>Han Li turned to look at Shen Kong sitting in the driver’s seat.
<br/><br/>This time, he changed his face again.<br/>His facial features were sharp and three-dimensional, with high brow bones and deeply set eyes beneath them. His eyes were exceptionally deep and bright. There was a piercing sharpness in their depths, like a bloodless blade that could easily take away one’s breath with just a simple gaze. There was a shallow scar on his right brow ridge, cutting along the bone’s path and stopping just before reaching the eyelid. The scar seemed relatively new, adding an extra layer of aggression and wildness to his already intense features. <br/>Han Li hurriedly averted his gaze.

<br/>He didn’t know why, but he had a strange feeling, as if…<br/>This was exactly how the other person was supposed to look like.<br/>Han Li took a deep breath. The sound of his own heartbeat seemed unusually loud and chaotic, making him feel somewhat agitated.

 <br/>As Shen Kong maneuvered the steering wheel, he asked:<br/>“Do you have any places you can go?”<br/>Han Li’s voice was calm and rational: “I do, but given this organization’s usual meticulous approach, I suspect all my properties and residences are being monitored. Staying in a hotel probably won’t work either. Their networked check-in systems are too easily hacked. We’d likely be found within thirty minutes of checking in.”

<br/>Shen Kong frowned: “You don’t have a safe house?” <br/>Almost everyone in a high position with substantial wealth would prepare a few safe houses for themselves. These would be hidden locations with clean property titles and owner identities. It has no connection to their real identities and is meant for emergencies.<br/>Han Li was silent for a while: “I used to have quite a few, but now I’m a well-known philanthropic entrepreneur. All my assets and properties are publicly transparent.”<br/>In other words, safe houses were no longer safe.<br/>Shen Kong: “……” <br/>To be a good person to this extent is quite impressive.<br/>He held the steering wheel with one hand. The car swerved sharply under his control. The sound of sirens outside the window quickly faded away. The rushing wind brushed against the car’s body, causing the windows to vibrate slightly.<br/>Han Li silently fastened his seatbelt.<br/>A dozen minutes later, the vehicle stopped in front of a single-family house. Shen Kong jumped out of the car, deftly avoided all surveillance cameras, and bypassed the security system. He opened the door within a few minutes. <br/>Han Li silently stared at the dark and open door in front of him, his expression inscrutable. He slowly turned to look at Shen Kong, his eyes filled with complex emotions.<br/>Shen Kong shrugged: “No safe house, can’t stay in a hotel, and the other options are too risky.”<br/><br/>Then, he added considerately: “Gon’t worry, from the security settings of the house, it looks like the owner needs to be away for a long time. The state of the door and the driveway suggests they left not too long ago, so there’s no need to worry.”<br/>Lan Oi: “……” <br/>Le took a deep breath and then stepped inside.<br/>Shen Kong turned on the lights, instantly brightening the room. He moved his stiff shoulders and neck and spoke casually:<br/>“Go and rest first, we’ll discuss anything else tomorrow.”<br/>As he spoke, he walked further inside. But after just a few steps, he felt someone grab his arm from behind. <br/>Shen Kong paused and turned to look back.<br/>Han Li seemed about to say something, but at that moment, Shen Kong suddenly frowned and raised his hand to press the tiny earpiece in his right ear.<br/>A strange fluctuation came through the static in the earpiece. A piercing sound stabbed into his eardrum like steel needles.<br/>Shen Kong had to remove the earpiece. When he put it back on, there was no sound at all—not even the static noise, just dead silence. <br/>It seemed they had discovered their communication device had been lost.<br/>He felt a bit regretful.<br/>Thanks to it, he was able to precisely avoid their pursuit and hidden searches. Even the driving route just now was planned to bypass their roadblocks, making their escape smooth and uneventful.<br/>But since it could no longer provide guidance, there was no need to keep it. If they installed a tracker in the earpiece, it would be even worse. <br/>Shen Kong removed the earpiece, casually threw it on the ground, and crushed it with his heel.<br/>The sound of metal being ground into the hard marble floor was particularly jarring in the quiet space, breaking the previously stagnant atmosphere in the room.<br/>Shen Kong turned to look at Han Li, who was still holding his arm, and raised an eyebrow: “What were you about to say?”<br/>Han Li slowly exhaled and loosened his stiff fingers slightly. He restrained himself and lowered his eyes, hiding the turmoil within them: <br/>“…Nothing.”<br/>Shen Kong didn’t press further.<br/>Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>In the next few brief minutes, they divided the rooms among themselves. Since the house belonged to someone else, they didn’t plan to use too many of its resources to make it easier to restore everything before they left.<br/>——But they still needed to take a shower. <br/>Shen Kong sniffed his sleeve and wrinkled his nose in disgust.<br/>He had been wearing these clothes ever since his previous mission before being kidnapped and made into that so-called rectifier. After entering this world, he kept them on. The fabric was now caked with mud and blood, forming a hardened shell. In the midst of danger, he didn’t care, but now that they were in a relatively safe environment, even with his strong endurance, the psychological and physical urge to change clothes became overwhelming.<br/>He quickly notified Han Li and then rushed into the bathroom.<br/>As a constantly vigilant combatant, Shen Kong always showered quickly. For him, the shorter the time spent on such physiologically relaxing activities, the better, as it reduced the likelihood of unexpected events. Even so, this time he spent over fifteen minutes in the shower. When Shen Kong opened the bathroom door and stepped out, steam billowed from behind him, warming the room by a few degrees. <br/>His expression was lazily relaxed. There was a new shallow scar on his right brow bone. A droplet of water traced the path of the scar before falling.<br/>Shen Kong looked up and saw Han Li sitting on the edge of the bed, seemingly waiting for him.<br/>His movements paused as he dried his hair. He casually draped the towel over his bare shoulder. His wet black hair stuck out in disarray under the light, with undried droplets falling onto the soft towel, leaving dark stains. Shen Kong asked with some confusion:<br/>“What’s wrong?” <br/>Han Li’s gaze fell on Shen Kong’s bare upper body, but he didn’t respond for a long time.<br/>The muscle contours on Shen Kong’s body were not overly pronounced. They didn’t look like they were sculpted in a gym. When covered by clothes, he even appeared somewhat lean. However, once his clothes were removed, the marks forged by years of intense life-and-death combat were starkly revealed. His body was highly efficient. Each solid, tightly packed muscle and bone fitted together perfectly, as if arranged to maximize human potential. No one could doubt the powerful strength hidden within the muscle lines under his skin.<br/>He resembled a resting beast stretching its limbs, with its sleek, shiny fur glistening in the sunlight.<br/>But that wasn’t what Han Li was looking at. <br/>He was looking at the scars covering Shen Kong’s shoulders, back, chest, abdomen, arms, and even his neck. Some of these scars seemed old, like cuts etched into tree bark, while others appeared fresh, pale, raised, and viciously spread across his limbs. Many scars were deep and terrifying. They were even located in vital areas, looking shocking and making one almost dread to imagine the perilous circumstances under which they were inflicted.<br/>Some people’s scars are wild and sexy, but Shen Kong’s are not.<br/>His scars were intimidating, ruthless, and deterrent.<br/>These scars covered his body, which was a near-perfect combination of mechanics and aesthetics, making one’s heart tremble. <br/>Han Li forced himself to move his gaze away from Shen Kong’s upper body and looked into his eyes instead:<br/>“I’ve changed my mind.”<br/>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>Shen Kong was taken aback: “…Hmm?”<br/>Han Li continued slowly, “You asked me earlier if I had anything to say, and I said nothing—but now I’ve changed my mind.” <br/>His voice remained calm and restrained. A deep, magnetic tone seemed to hold back his deeper emotions. His eyes were fixed on Shen Kong, as dark as moonlight over a black sea.<br/>Shen Kong looked back, feeling a bit of a headache from the unwavering persistence and probing in Han Li’s eyes. He sighed and finally relented:<br/>“Okay, what do you want to say?”<br/>Han Li took a deep breath: “Just a simple question.” <br/>He paused, as if preparing himself mentally, then finally spoke slowly and solemnly:<br/>“…Are you still going to leave?”<br/>The syllables flowed smoothly, as if he had rehearsed this question in his mind countless times, with hardly any emotional fluctuations.<br/>Shen Kong couldn’t help but be slightly stunned. Before Han Li spoke, several possible questions already flashed through his mind——Who exactly are you? What are you? Why are you doing this? How did you end up in someone else’s body?… <br/>There were so many questions he could have asked, with so many mysteries and doubts between them, but Shen Kong didn’t expect Han Li to ask this particular question.<br/>And it was a question he indeed… couldn’t answer.<br/>Shen Kong truly didn’t know if he would be transmitted away again. Although the connection between the Three Views Rectifying Studio and the sub-world seemed to be weakening, with the system contacting him less frequently and responding slower and quieter, the ultimate outcome would only be clear after the crisis was resolved.<br/>As if noticing Shen Kong’s hesitation, Han Li suddenly took a step forward and closed the distance between them instantly. <br/>He raised his hand and grabbed Shen Kong’s arm, pressing where he had forced himself to let go earlier. His fingertips dug into the solid muscles of Shen Kong’s forearm——<br/>Han Li stubbornly gazed into Shen Kong’s eyes, his stare seeming to penetrate every barrier between them. In the depths of his dark pupils, cold flames burned:<br/>“In case you didn’t know…”<br/>He paused, as if making a significant decision, and then continued, word by word: <br/>“I love you.”<br/>Han Li’s gaze was deep and intense. They were completely unguarded and genuine, as if he were laying his entire soul bare before Shen Kong, holding out a bleeding and throbbing heart in his hands.<br/><br/>His straightforward and fervent emotion overflowed from his restrained voice and eyes. Like a moth drawn to a flame, it rushed toward Shen Kong as if he were the only light in an endless darkness, heedless of the injuries he might suffer.<br/>He used no compromising words. <br/>It wasn’t “like.”<br/>It wasn’t a “crush.”<br/>But “love.”</div>
