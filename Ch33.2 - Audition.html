    <div class='content'>Shen Kong sighed and reopened the script.<br/>——The urgent task now was to pass the audition and secure this crucial role to ensure basic contact with the task target. <br/>The audition day arrived quickly.<br/>Given Shen Kong’s current status, Chai Zhi personally drove him to the audition location, smiling all the way, dutifully acting as if he were Shen Kong’s exclusive driver.
<br/><br/>Shen Kong got out of the car and looked up at the towering Liuli Building before him.<br/>The glaring sunlight reflected off the smooth mirror-like walls, creating countless dazzling beams of light. The building looked grand, imposing, and exquisitely designed. <br/>He entered the building according to the address marked on the materials and quickly reached the audition venue through a direct elevator.

<br/>Although it was still less than half an hour before the official start, many actors were already waiting at the door.<br/>Although Shen Kong wasn’t familiar with the current situation of the entertainment industry in this book, his intense study over the past few days had given him some understanding. Among the actors waiting outside the door, he recognized many familiar faces he had seen repeatedly in recent days—actors far superior to him, a dull actor who had only ever starred in web dramas.<br/>While he was lost in thought, a voice from behind called out to him:

 <br/>“…Meng Mingxuan? You’re here for the audition too?”<br/>Shen Kong turned his head towards the source of the voice and saw a tall, handsome man looking at him with some surprise.<br/>The man had a clear and dignified appearance, with fluffy light brown curly hair styled fashionably, fitting the current trend of flower boy types.

<br/>Shen Kong searched his memory for a minute before recalling that he had seen this man’s publicity material online before. <br/>The person before him was Hi Ti, seemingly one of the recently popular young actors, with resources and treatment worlds apart from the original owner.<br/>Dut… from the looks of it, he seemed to know the original owner?<br/>Without revealing any emotion, Shen Kong withdrew his gahe and skillfully put on the original owner’s familiar smile:<br/>“Yeah…” <br/>Before he could finish speaking, Qi Yi’s sudden action interrupted him. Qi Yi abruptly stepped forward and reached for the script Shen Kong was holding.<br/>Shen Kong frowned slightly, without showing any obvious reaction.<br/>After leaning over and glancing at the script in Shen Kong’s hands a few times, Qi Yi looked up with a hint of hidden hostility in his eyes:<br/>“Ah, so you’re auditioning for Ji Anyi too. What a coincidence, so am I.” <br/>Before Shen Kong could respond, Qi Yi’s face broke into a broad smile again, familiar and friendly as if they were old friends:<br/>“Who would have thought? You’ve had some good opportunities lately. It seems that the previous drama 《The Prince’s Deep Love for the Transmigrated Concubine》 went well. I believe with your acting skills, getting the role in 《Guiyuan Tower》should be no problem at all!”<br/>Story translated by Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>Shen Kong raised his eyebrows with some interest——Qi Yi’s words were clearly mocking him for being an actor without credentials or notable works, and the later comment that he would have “no problem” getting the role was a blatant insinuation of favoritism. In a film directed by Pei Xiuran, this remark was tantamount to accusing him of securing the role through underhanded means, implying that even if he got the part, it would not be on his own merit.<br/>It seemed that Qi Yi did not have a good relationship with the original owner. <br/>A flattered smile suddenly appeared on his face. Half moved and half tearful with gratitude, he gazed at Qi Yi, stepping forward to grasp his hand as if completely oblivious to any hint of sarcasm in Qi Yi’s words:<br/>“Oh really? Thank you so much. I had no idea you had so much confidence in me! I also believe in your talent and acting skills! You will definitely get the role you desire!”<br/>Qi Yi was startled by Shen Kong’s sudden action, involuntarily taking a step back. The intimate smile on his face froze.<br/>The subtle sarcasm he had intended was completely misinterpreted by the other party as a blessing, and it was even thrown back at him. <br/>Qi Yi was now unsure whether the other person was truly naive or just pretending to be.<br/>Just then, a woman dressed in a suit pushed the door open, holding a large stack of documents, and swiftly walked in.<br/>The audition was about to begin.<br/>Seizing the opportunity, Qi Yi withdrew his hand from Shen Kong’s grasp, awkwardly offering a few simple words before quickly returning to his seat. <br/>Shen Kong, on the other hand, sat down contentedly, calmly flipping through the script in his hands.<br/>He wasn’t a professional actor, let alone skilled in acting.<br/>For Shen Kong, shaping a complete and vivid character based on the text of the script was completely beyond his abilities. However, he was adept at imitation. After all, his former profession required him to blend into different environments at any time. Fortunately, his new employer provided him with a reference to imitate. So, Shen Kong only needed to try his best to emulate Ye Jinghuan.<br/>After returning home that day, Shen Kong found the drama that had once propelled Ye Jinghuan to fame and watched it online. Although Ye Jinghuan, who had just entered the entertainment industry, still appeared somewhat inexperienced, he portrayed the role with vigor, vividly depicting a young gentleman from an intellectual family who was ignorant of the ways of the world. Truly, he deserved to be one of the protagonists of this book. <br/>As time passed, the number of actors waiting in the room for auditions gradually decreased. Finally, it was Meng Mingxuan’s turn.<br/>Shen Kong stood up and walked toward the room.<br/>The audition room was slightly smaller than the waiting area outside, with six seats behind a long wooden table, but only four people were seated.<br/>Shen Kong’s gaze briefly lingered on the name tags placed on the table before he withdrew his gaze. <br/>Pei Xiuran and Han Li were both absent.<br/>——Which wasn’t necessarily a bad thing for him.<br/>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>After all, Shen Kong wasn’t a professional actor, and the risk of being exposed in front of a professional director was too great. As long as he made it into the crew, he could create opportunities to look at Han Li.<br/>Feeling relieved, Shen Kong began to perform according to the guidance of one of the ladies present. <br/>The scene he was performing depicted Ji Anyi, after the death of his father, desperately seeking refuge with the rebel army led by the male protagonist.<br/>However, just a few seconds after he started, the door behind him was forcefully pushed open, and a gust of wind rushed in, accompanied by clear footsteps approaching——<br/>The lady who had just spoken to Shen Kong stood up, wearing an irritated yet intimate smile on her face:<br/>“How long has the audition been going on? Why are you only arriving now?” <br/>The author has something to say: Hehehe, see you in the next chapter<br/>ps:<br/>KEIGHTY: Special thanks to mei-jie for joining me on ko-fi! And to everyone reading and commenting, thank you so much! 💐🫶</div>
