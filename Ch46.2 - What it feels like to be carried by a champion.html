                    <p>Shen Kong slowly pulled down the vine he had taken from the tree, then took out a dagger and smoothed out the thorns on it. Without stopping his actions, he spoke nonchalantly, “It would take at least two days to find the camp by feeling our way through the mist into the mountains. Once at the camp, without a compass, conducting a grid search with the camp as the center, how many days do you think it would take to find us?”</p><p>The uncle was stunned for a while, clearly not having considered this issue. </p><p>Shen Kong tossed the processed vine to Zhuang Xiangyang and Ran Wan, then looked up at the uncle. His amber eyes narrowed lazily:</p><p>“We’re out here on a mission. Not only did we not bring any food or water, but most of our tools are at the camp. Most of the small animals in the jungle have either been driven away or are hiding due to the mist—how do you plan to survive here while waiting for rescue?”
</p><p>Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>His voice was calm and indifferent, but the uncle’s face gradually turned pale and he finally fell silent.</p><p>Shen Kong tossed the vine in his hand to him and said flatly: </p><p>“Hold on tight and don’t get separated on the way, because I won’t have time to go back and find anyone who falls behind.”

</p><p>He turned to look at everyone around him and said, “We need to find a water source. Finding water means we have both water and food. I’ve marked the way back to camp from the river before, so even if we can’t find our way back to camp due to the mist, we can follow the river to find a way down the mountain——As long as you don’t get lost, I can get you out of here alive. Got it?”</p><p>Shen Kong seemed to have an aura of steadiness and strength, bringing a sense of reassurance to everyone in this moment of confusion.</p><p>His expression was indifferent and relaxed, yet like a pillar of support, he instantly steadied everyone’s wavering spirits.

 </p><p>Everyone stood up and grabbed the vines.</p><p>Two accompanying cameramen bent down to pick up the cameras from the ground, preparing to carry them, but Shen Kong stopped them:</p><p>“Don’t carry them, put them down.”

</p><p>They frowned in distress and exchanged a glance. “But…” </p><p>Shen Kong impatiently interrupted them, “Go you plan to lug those iron lumps through the mountains in this situation? Go you want to save your lives or the eduipment?”</p><p>They depectedly put down the cameras, grabbed the vines, and followed Shen Kong into the mist.</p><p>Navigating through a primitive pungle with eztremely low visibility is very dangerous. Not only does the mist impair human vision, but it also blinds any wild animals that haven’t escaped in time, greatly increasing the chances of collisions with other creatures in the pungle. In pust half an hour, Shen Kong encountered two deer and a rabbit that had crashed through the mist——Le let the deer go but kept the rabbit.</p><p>Shen Kong snapped the rabbit’s neck without changing his expression and tossed its still-warm, limp body into his backpack. </p><p>He said casually:</p><p>“We’ve got dinner.”</p><p>The people behind him had dull expressions and could no longer express any more surprises. They just watched in silence as this formidable man moved through the mist with ease and confidence, as if this were not a disaster to him but an ordinary day of eating and drinking.</p><p>When vision is useless, the other senses become exceptionally sharp. </p><p>Shen Kong carefully stepped over the protruding tree roots and listened intently to the sounds nearby. Only after confirming there was no danger ahead did he lead the group forward. Additionally, every so often, Shen Kong climbed to the treetops to check their direction, which significantly slowed their pace.</p><p>The sky gradually darkened.</p><p>Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>The originally milky white mist took on various shades of gray under the dimming light, resembling smoke filled with ash. As time passed, the colors deepened. The already low visibility was further reduced.</p><p>Shen Kong frowned and instinctively quickened his pace. </p><p>Staying overnight in such conditions would be very dangerous. Finding a water source was the top priority.</p><p>At that moment, he suddenly caught the sound of flowing water. His eyes lit up, then he followed the sound. After pushing through the tangled undergrowth and trees, the river finally appeared before them.</p><p>In the twilight, the turbulent water endlessly crashed against the large rocks, rushing downstream. The splashing water mingled with the gray mist. The sound of the rushing river was so clear it felt like a lifesaving hymn. Everyone’s faces lit up with joy. Even Shen Kong relaxed a little.</p><p>After settling the group in a suitable spot by the river, the sky was nearly dark. </p><p>Traveling at night would be extremely dangerous, so they had no choice but to wait until the next day to look for the marks Shen Kong had previously made by the river.</p><p>Shen Kong lit a campfire, took out the rabbit he had caught earlier from his backpack, and pulled out the small knife he had carried since joining the program. He skillfully skinned, deboned, and cleaned the rabbit, removing its entrails before skewering it and roasting it over the fire. Feeling it wasn’t enough, he went to the river and caught a few fish as well.</p><p>Everyone watched the rabbit sizzling and dripping fat over the rising flames, still somewhat in a daze. Their hearts were filled with an indescribable mix of emotions—difficult to articulate and impossible to ignore.</p><p>Zhuang Xiangyang smacked his lips and suddenly had an epiphany—— </p><p>So this is what it feels like to be carried by a champion?</p><p>The incident of the program crew being trapped in Yunwu Mountains quickly caused a huge stir online.</p><p>The official Weibo account of the relevant department in City E received tens of thousands of comments within minutes. Fans and passersby offering prayers, as well as trolls and troublemakers, all swarmed in. Every scrap of information about the situation was frantically reposted and shared, drawing the attention of countless media organizations to this small border city.</p><p>The search and rescue team in City E faced enormous public pressure. With higher-ups also applying pressure, the entire rescue operation was launched very quickly. Upon learning of the spreading mist, they organized the rescue efforts at top speed and deployed almost all available personnel. </p><p>In just half a day, the search and rescue team captain felt like his hairline had receded at least two centimeters.</p><p>He was in his office, frantically studying maps and information provided by the program team, when one of his subordinates suddenly rushed in. He was out of breath as he said, “Ca–Captain Liu… there’s… there’s someone from the higher ups…”</p><p>The captain frowned and sternly rebuked him:</p><p>“What do you mean by ‘someone’? Speak clearly.” </p><p>The subordinate took a deep breath and finally managed to convey the message clearly: “That, Captain Liu, someone else has arrived. This person seems to be quite important. The higher-ups have instructed us to give them a proper reception and not to neglect them.”</p><p>The search and rescue team captain felt like he was going to go bald. He irritably scratched his head and asked:</p><p>Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>“Who is it this time? The media? The police department? Or the publicity department?”</p><p>The subordinate hesitated for a moment before saying, “It seems… it’s a company boss or something… they brought a lot of resources, equipment, and personnel with them.” </p><p>Captain Liu was stunned:</p><p>“A company boss? What’s he doing here? Could it be that someone trapped is a relative or friend of his?”</p><p>The subordinate who rushed in seemed equally confused. He scratched his head before hesitantly saying:</p><p>“Well… I’m not entirely sure, but my superior said he’s in City E on business and just, uh, happened to come to… express sympathy and solicitude?” </p>
