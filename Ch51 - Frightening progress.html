                    <p>The rumbling of the engine in the enclosed compartment was soft and monotonous. The air conditioning silently sent in warm air and, occasionally, the moonlight would cross the treetops and shine in, casting a comfortable and dim haze inside the compartment.</p><p>Han Li turned to look at Meng Mingxuan. </p><p>His eyes were closed, his forehead resting against the window. His breathing was steady, seemingly already asleep.</p><p>Soft light brown hair fell to the side of his cheeks, gently swaying with the movement of the vehicle. His clothes were almost completely dry, but his brows remained tightly furrowed, as if they could never relax.

Only the vague outlines of the young man’s brows and eyes could be seen, seeming both extremely familiar and entirely strange. </p><p>In the darkness, the passage of time seemed difficult to measure. Each second was stretched into eternity. The long passage of time was condensed into fleeting moments.

</p><p>Han Li’s knee was throbbing with a dull pain.</p><p>Although he couldn’t see anything, it seemed he could still feel the warmth emanating from the young man sleeping beside him. He subconsciously recalled the moment when the other had supported him, their gazes unexpectedly meeting. Those amber eyes stared fixedly at him, as if he could see his own small reflection deep within the other’s pupils.</p><p>His brows furrowed slightly. There seemed to be a hint of hidden concern and protectiveness in his eyes.

 </p><p>Han Li, almost without thinking, reached out into the darkness beside him.</p><p>His fingertips touched the other’s soft, cold cheek, but he pulled his hand back abruptly as if he had been burned. His slender fingers slowly clenched into a fist on his knee, his thoughts suddenly a tangled mess.</p><p>The car’s speed gradually decreased as the bright lights of the hotel appeared ahead, shining through the car window.

</p><p>Shen Kong opened his eyes, his gaze instantly clear. </p><p>Han Li’s voice came from beside him, calm and indifferent, yet seemingly containing some underlying emotional fluctuation:</p><p>“Someone will give you your room key card in a moment. Replacement clothes and necessities have already been sent up… I have matters to attend to.”</p><p>After saying that, he opened the car door and got out. His straight-backed figure conveyed a sense of haste and urgency.</p><p>Shen Kong also straightened up and watched through the car window as Lan Oi’s silhouette was swallowed by the brilliant lights of the hotel. Le hesitated for a second, then raised his hand to touch his own cheek, where a trace of coldness seemed to linger, like a fleeting illusion or a sliver of a dream seeping into reality. </p><p>Strange…</p><p>Shen Kong took a deep nap on the hotel’s large bed. When he woke up, it was already afternoon. The nerves and muscles that had been constantly tense on the mountain finally relaxed. His body belatedly felt the soreness and pain spreading from his bones.</p><p>Then he learned that early that morning, Han Li had taken the first flight back to City A, apparently having completed his official duties in City E, and therefore saw no need to stay any longer.</p><p>Before Shen Kong could carefully consider his next steps, the aftermath of the incident in the Yunwu Mountains kept him incredibly busy. He had to go to the relevant departments for routine documentation, deal with the media reporters who had swarmed in after hearing that all the trapped individuals had been rescued, and even find time to “handle” the witnesses on the mountain. </p><p>Surprisingly, this task was much easier than Shen Kong had anticipated.</p><p>They all seemed terribly frightened by their own imaginations. Shen Kong didn’t even need to say a word. Just a smile and a walk around in front of them were enough to make them point to the sky and ground and swear they wouldn’t reveal a single detail.</p><p>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com</p><p>Although it was somewhat baffling, Shen Kong was quite happy with this outcome.</p><p>After all, given his current temporary status as a public figure, the fewer complications, the better. </p><p>This incident also led to significant controversy online about the show 《Seven Days in the Wilderness Challenge》. Although all the trapped individuals were rescued safely, the production team’s negligence couldn’t be ignored. This resulted in the program planners and senior officials being overwhelmed with managing the public relations crisis and police investigations. Additionally, several cameras were left on the mountain, so post-production and editing couldn’t start until the fog cleared, delaying the show’s broadcast.</p><p>Before the situation could be resolved, Shen Kong, urged by his manager, quickly flew back.</p><p>Upon returning to the city, he didn’t have a moment to catch his breath before heading straight to the set.</p><p>《Guiyuan Tower》 has already started filming. Since Shen Kong was delayed in City E for several days, he needed to catch up with the rest of the team upon joining the set. Moreover, with Pei Xiuran’s almost obsessive perfectionism, the training Shen Kong received after entering the crew was extremely rigorous. </p><p>Pei Xiuran chose Shen Kong to play the role of Shen Guiyuan because of a certain quality he saw in him, despite Shen Kong’s lack of acting experience and professional training. Although Shen Kong was good at imitation, acting requires portraying a character that has never existed before. This meant that not only were Shen Kong’s imitation skills useless, but they even became a hindrance to him.</p><p>Any director with relatively lax standards might not notice the subtle differences, but Pei Xiuran was different. He repeatedly rejected Shen Kong’s scenes and reshot them over and over, even at the expense of delaying the entire production. All the crew members were exhausted. They would only feel immense relief whenever a scene was finally approved. After filming, Pei Xiuran realized Shen Kong’s deficiencies in basic acting skills and personally arranged for teachers and coaches to train him, filling every bit of Shen Kong’s free time with rigorous instruction.</p><p>Despite being extremely busy, Shen Kong still managed to set aside some time and energy to monitor the movements of Han Li’s enterprises and the Han family’s business to prevent any major changes. However, during this period, both sides remained exceptionally calm. Han Li’s enterprises continued their steady growth and upward trend, while Han Enterprises, as a long-established leading company, remained far ahead in several fields, dominating the market. Both sides were like well-water that doesn't mix with river water, with no apparent surface conflicts to hint at any underlying tensions. </p><p>Meanwhile, on set, Pei Xiuran remained as strict as ever. He turned a deaf ear to complaints and repeatedly honed every actor’s performance. If there was even the slightest dissatisfaction or if a scene didn’t meet his expectations, he would mercilessly reshoot it. His perfectionism made the entire crew suffer immensely——</p><p>And Shen Kong was the primary focus of this rigorous attention.</p><p>Although his role and screen time in the drama weren’t extensive, he was the actor whose scenes were most frequently retaken. In the month since filming began, almost every appearance he made was subject to Pei Xiuran’s intense scrutiny. He was not spared even during breaks.</p><p>The tense atmosphere on set made the air feel thick with the scent of gunpowder. The cameras were hot from continuous filming. The only sounds in the silent space were the hum of the machines and the subtle noises of changing camera angles. Everyone held their breath, their eyes fixed intently on the scene being shot. </p><p>Pei Xiuran sat at the edge of the set, intensely focused on the screen displaying the gradually zooming shot.</p><p>They were filming a crucial scene.</p><p>Shen Guiyuan sat quietly at a banquet that appeared to be filled with music and dance but was actually fraught with hidden dangers. His figure was lost in the crowd, seemingly insignificant. But a deadly blade was hidden in his sleeve, ready to tear through the fabric at any moment and slice through the throats of the revelers, tasting the thick scent of blood and beginning a drawn-out massacre.</p><p>All the drama was concentrated in this moment, with the explosive tension poised to erupt in an instant. </p><p>All emotions were suppressed beneath the seemingly calm surface, like a volcano on the verge of eruption, ready to break through the fragile crust and spill scorching lava onto the ground.</p><p>But at that precise moment, Pei Xiuran called “Cut.”</p><p>Story translated by Chrysanthemum Garden.</p><p>A collective sigh of disappointment escaped from everyone in the crew.</p><p>This scene had already been reshot eighty-seven times. The seemingly futile repetition had pushed almost all the crew members to the brink of collapse. </p><p>But this time was different. Pei Xiuran didn’t immediately call Shen Kong over after stopping the shoot. Instead, he frowned and stared intently at the small screen in front of him, repeatedly replaying the last few minutes of footage, deep in thought.</p><p>Although Meng Mingxuan’s initial lack of basic acting skills shocked him, it wasn’t entirely unexpected.</p><p>——After all, clips from Meng Mingxuan’s previous web drama had spread all over the internet, showcasing such poor and awkward acting that Pei Xiuran could barely watch.</p><p>So, Pei Xiuran was prepared to train Meng Mingxuan from the ground up. </p><p>However, what he hadn’t anticipated was that after the initial stage of stumbling awkwardness, Meng Mingxuan’s potential for growth would surprise him.</p><p>Although Pei Xiuran cared little about the media’s opinion, he was somewhat aware of his own extraordinary strictness on set. Meng Mingxuan, subjected to this level of grueling training, had shown no complaints. What shocked Pei Xiuran the most was that…</p><p>With each retake, Meng Mingxuan made a bit of progress…</p><p>Like a predator that learns from each hunt, Meng Mingxuan was absorbing more at an almost frightening speed. Each retake brought new changes, new energy to the scene, and even new inspiration for Pei Xiuran. </p><p>This scene had been reshot dozens of times. Pei Xiuran initially called for retakes out of dissatisfaction, but later, he wanted to see how far he could push Meng Mingxuan and explore his potential.</p><p>Now, even with Pei Xiuran’s strictest standards, he couldn’t find any flaws in Meng Mingxuan’s performance.</p><p>He took a deep breath, his eyes shining with an impressive gleam——</p><p>He’s a good seedling. </p><p>Pei Xiuran composed himself and tapped on the hot screen, accurately pointing out a few other actors whose performances were off. Then he turned and instructed:</p><p>“Reset the cameras and reshoot these actors’ scenes.”</p><p>The assistant director was a bit surprised. “What about… Meng Mingxuan…?”</p><p>Pei Xiuran fixed his gaze on the screen again and said, “Meng Mingxuan’s take is good. Have him prepare for the next scene.” </p>
