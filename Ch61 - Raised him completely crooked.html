    <div class='content'>Han Li slowly placed the evidence back into the envelope. The rustling sound of the paper bag sounded particularly clear in the dead silent study.<br/>The man standing behind him stared wide-eyed in shock, seemingly unable to comprehend the turn of events. For a moment, he couldn’t even control his facial expressions. “This…” <br/>Han Li lowered his eyes. His voice was calm and steady:<br/>“At first, I indeed did not suspect that my family and biological father would be so ruthless, but after two consecutive days and nights, with seven waves of mercenaries—no matter how foolish I might be, I wouldn’t think that a stepmother without family backing could mobilize such financial and powerful resources.”

The flickering lights made intermittent dark glows as they swayed with the ceiling’s vibrations. Dust fell down from above as the young boy huddled in fear under the thin sheets. The effects of the anesthesia hadn’t completely worn off. He struggled to maintain his consciousness in the midst of dizziness and lethargy, silently counting the chaotic footsteps overhead, while a sentence that made his blood run cold echoed repeatedly in his mind:<br/>——”Kid, do you still not know who wants your life up until now?” <br/>The seed of doubt was deeply planted then, and it took root and sprouted whenever given the chance.

<br/>Han Li gently caressed the top of his cane, his eyes as dark as a deep pool. He continued to speak:<br/>“So, after returning to the country, I began searching for the truth of that year. Money and power, though they can’t bring the dead back to life, are indeed effective in this area, like a cure for a disease.”<br/>Shen Kong gazed at Han Li sitting in the middle of the room and slowly furrowed his brows——Although Han Li’s expression seemed unchanged, for some reason, he gave Shen Kong an almost fragile illusion.

 <br/>For a moment, Shen Kong was somewhat dazed.<br/>It was as if that thin, small child stood before him, silently watching him with wary eyes.<br/>But this feeling vanished in an instant. In the next second, Han Li once again became that decisive and strategic adult man who possessed a strong physique and astonishing wealth and power. Even just sitting there quietly, he had an undeniable presence that no one dared to underestimate.

<br/>Shen Kong suddenly became acutely aware of the passage of time. <br/>Though it had only been a few months for him, it had been a full twenty years for Han Li.<br/>Even though he had long known this was the way to complete the task, it was the first time he so clearly felt the impermanence and absurdity of the changing times.<br/>At that moment, through the heavy door, Shen Kong suddenly caught a faint sound from the corridor.<br/>His heart skipped a beat. But before he could think further, he heard a gentle knock on the tightly closed door. Immediately after, the door was pushed open. <br/>A tall man walked in.<br/>He had a handsome face, and his clothes draped loosely over his shoulders. His features had matured, but traces of his youthful appearance were still visible.<br/>Shen Kong was stunned.<br/>…Wasn’t this the same person he encountered at the school gate in the previous timeline? <br/>According to those thuggish punks with shaved cockscomb heads, his name seemed to be… Oin Iiyu?<br/>This name instantly triggered Shen Kong’s memory. Le recalled that this name appeared in the plot transmitted to him by the system——Oin Iiyu originally came from a family with ties to the underworld. After becoming Lan Oi’s trusted subordinate, he assisted him in managing the dark domain under his control. Sven after Lan Oi was betrayed by one of his subordinates, Oin Iiyu remained loyal.<br/><br/>In the previous timeline, the system’s plot for Shen Kong did not include Lin Ziyu at all. Due to the butterfly effect, their meeting had been moved up significantly to their high school years.<br/>Lin Ziyu briefly scanned the room, then fixed his gaze on Han Li and cheerfully said: <br/>“Han-ge, everything is done.”<br/>The man standing behind Han Li suddenly had a foreboding feeling. He turned his head warily towards Han Li and asked:<br/>“What has been done?”<br/>Han Li did not answer his question. Instead, Lin Ziyu arrogantly raised his eyebrows and said with a smile: <br/>“Of course, we have removed the people you planted among us. Why do you think Han-ge didn’t make a move after gathering so much dirt on the Han family? It was to let you reveal your true colors. Who does that Fe-whatever think he is, daring to mess with us? Fuck him.”<br/>As soon as Lin Ziyu finished speaking, several people surged in from behind him. In the blink of an eye, they subdued the people in the room.<br/>One of them came over and untied Shen Kong and Tang Sheng.<br/>Shen Kong gently rotated his stiff wrists. His long eyelashes lowered, hiding the inscrutable look in his eyes. <br/>He now understood why Han Li delayed his move. Unlike the original plot, it wasn’t because he still had feelings and hopes for the Han family. It was because there was a more powerful opponent on the chessboard. To lull this opponent into a false sense of security and seize the initiative in the shadows, Han Li adopted a strategy of lying low.<br/>Han Li’s growth already surpassed that of the ruthless and cold-blooded villain in the original plot.<br/>He was no longer just an heir whom Feminster valued so highly that he would use any means to bring him into his fold, but became an evenly matched adversary capable of turning the tables.<br/>The man’s face changed. He put away his respectful demeanor and asked gloomily: <br/>“So, what do you want?”<br/>Han Li shook his head. His eyes were as deep and dark as an abyss, but his voice was still calm: “I won’t harm you. I just hope you can convey a message. I still have great respect for Mr. Feminster, but I must firmly reject his invitation. I also hope he won’t try to use other extreme methods to coerce me. Next time, I may not be as amicable as I am now.”<br/>The man’s face darkened even more:<br/>“Many people would kill for Mr. Feminster’s favor. Don’t be so ungrateful!” <br/>Lin Ziyu frowned and instinctively wanted to speak, but was stopped by Han Li raising his hand.<br/>He unwillingly crossed his arms and swallowed his unspoken words.<br/>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>Han Li gave the man a faint smile: “Inheriting an already established empire, in the end, lacks challenge.”<br/>The ambition flickering in his eyes was like a wild fire burning freely in the abyss: <br/>“I prefer to create one that suits my taste.”<br/>Shen Kong, who had been silently observing, finally understood the source of his earlier sense of foreboding. He couldn’t help but fall into a deep reflection on his own methods of guidance.<br/>If this world were a nurturing game…<br/>——Then he fucking raised him completely crooked… <br/>A few minutes later, the man and his subordinates were politely escorted out. Han Zhuang, who had witnessed everything, was now as pale as a sheet. The previously ruthless and tough demeanor seemed to melt away at his feet, revealing his weak and ineffectual nature beneath the bravado. Whether it was Han Li’s manipulations of his company, the mention of Feminster, or Han Li’s apparent upper hand in their confrontation, all of it exceeded his expectations. Although he was no longer as capable as he was in his youth, he could still see that he had clearly lost his grip on power.<br/>He tried to make a desperate struggle and switched to playing the emotional card, but his words, like his expressions, were pale and powerless.<br/>Bian Xianjing also understood the situation. She cried pitifully and pleaded, while the short-sighted and incompetent Han Zizhuo still tried to maintain the airs of the Han family’s young master, shouting emptily and fearfully. The study, which had just quieted down, was again filled with noisy clamor. However, Han Li didn’t even raise an eyebrow. He merely stood up from the sofa and slowly walked to Han Zhuang’s desk.<br/>He took a photo out of the inner pocket of his suit and gently laid it on the desk, smoothing it out with his fingertips. <br/>In the yellowed photo, a beautiful and graceful woman smiled reservedly at the camera. Her features bore some resemblance to Han Li’s, but her expression carried a hint of melancholy and gentleness.<br/>Shen Kong recognized it as the photo Han Li had taken from the Han family’s main residence that day.<br/>Han Zhuang suddenly fell silent. Large beads of sweat rolled down his temples. His fingers twitched slightly on the desk.<br/>Han Li spoke slowly and methodically: <br/>“I know Feminster wants to provoke me into action with that information.”<br/>He paused. The entire room quickly fell silent. No one dared to make a sound. A heavy and oppressive atmosphere filled the space, making it hard to breathe.<br/>Han Zhuang forced a smile, barely managing to form it: “Thank you, thank you for not doing that…”<br/>Before he could finish, Han Li interrupted him: “No, you misunderstood.” <br/>Han Li looked at Han Zhuang, who seemed to have aged ten years in an instant, and said calmly:<br/>“——I just don’t want to act under coercion. I want this to be a well-thought-out decision… not one made in a moment of passion.”<br/>Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>He extended his hand. Lin Ziyu quickly stepped forward and placed a heavy gun into Han Li’s hand.<br/>There was no hint of killing intent in Han Li’s eyes, only a dead calm, like a desolate plain after a harsh wind, without any emotional fluctuation. <br/>He pulled the safety bolt and slowly raised the gun.<br/>At that moment, a very soft sigh came from the darkness not far away. It seemed like it would be blown away by the flowing air in the vast sky the next second, yet it reached Han Li’s ears with crystal clarity.<br/>He paused slightly and turned his head in the direction of the sound.<br/>A slender young man emerged from the darkness. His figure was gradually illuminated by the light overhead, as if unveiling a curtain and shedding his disguise. <br/>The usual smile on his face vanished, leaving an expression that was bland and indifferent. His light-colored eyes, which seemed to keep people at a distance, lazily narrowed. They held a nearly cruel, primal wildness that made those who looked into them feel as if they were being cut by a cold blade.<br/>Just like when they first met.<br/>Shen Kong stopped a few steps away from Han Li and raised an eyebrow:<br/>“You did a good job, kid.” <br/>All this time, Han Li’s hand had been incredibly steady, whether opening envelopes containing deadly secrets or raising the heavy gun. But at this moment, his hand involuntarily trembled slightly.</div>
