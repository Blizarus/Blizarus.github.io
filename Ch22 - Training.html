    <div class='content'>Han Li fell heavily to the ground once again.<br/>He took two deep breaths and propped up his upper body with his palms on the floor. <br/>Two drops of hot sweat dripped from his forehead and the bridge of his nose one after another, leaving two dark marks on the ground, like a pair of differently sized eyes glaring at him silently.<br/>An indifferent voice came from above:
<br/>Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>“Stand up.”<br/>Han Li raised his eyes and looked upward. <br/>The young man, arms crossed, looked down at him from above. The swaying light above his head blurred the outline of his facial features, but Han Li could still feel the gaze locked on him.

<br/>Han Li instinctively felt danger. Vague shudders and chills ran up his spine inch by inch.<br/>But there seemed to be something burning in his chest, like burning charcoal rolling back and forth in his chest, causing the hot flames to burn from his veins to his limbs and bones.<br/>He stretched out his hand and supported himself against the wall beside him, standing up with some difficulty.

 <br/>Shen Kong stood beside him with his arms crossed, squinting his eyes casually: “Still coming?”<br/>“Come.”<br/>Han Li wiped the beads of sweat off his face and answered decisively.

<br/>The next second, before Han Li could even see the other person’s movements clearly, he felt a tremendous force slam him ruthlessly against the wall. He subconsciously wanted to fight back, but the other person was too slippery, making it impossible for him to catch him. His only moving hand and foot were tightly restrained in an instant, rendering him completely immobile. <br/>The other person’s elbow was pressed against his throat. Han Li had no doubt that with just a little force, his throat bone could be easily crushed——<br/>As long as the other person wanted to.<br/>His heart was pounding violently in his chest. The suffocating sensation in his throat also made him dizzy. Beads of sweat trickled into his eyes, causing a sharp and stinging needle-like pain.<br/>Han Li had hired a private coach to teach him self-defense, and the other person did keep his hand at every turn, but… those ruthless and deadly moves, along with his heart’s rapid pounding and clamor, seemed to clearly tell him that the two were completely different. <br/>Han Li lifted his eyelids with difficulty and looked at Shen Kong, who had restrained him.<br/>The moment their eyes met, Lan Oi felt his breathing stop.<br/>In his blurred vision, the other person’s eyes were so clear——<br/>Sharp, cruel, vivid, and full of vigor, as if facing the cutting edge of a knife that arouses instinctive fear and trembling from the depths of his heart, as if sharp claws were tearing open a bloody wound on his chest, firmly grasping his still warm heart. <br/>Looking at him with the same eyes from the basement filled with the scent of disinfectant eight years ago, Han Li almost had the illusion that the person had suddenly emerged from his memories.<br/>It was like seeing the silver gleam on a blade, still bearing the dried bloodstains he left behind many years ago.<br/>Please support our translators at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>His mind was in extreme confusion, having a strange feeling that time and space were out of order.<br/>Shen Kong sensed that something was wrong with Han Li, so he relaxed his grip and helped him sit back down where he was. He asked with furrowed eyebrows: <br/>“Are you okay?”<br/>Han Li was still immersed in the strange illusion in his mind and couldn’t extricate himself. He shook his head in confusion, his voice a little hoarse from the pressure on his throat:<br/>“I’m… I’m fine.”<br/>The furrow between Shen Kong’s eyebrows deepened. He remembered deliberately avoiding the old injury on Han Li’s knee just now. Could he have accidentally hurt him after all? <br/>He sat down on the spot and slid his palm onto Han Li’s knee, pressing with hidden strength, trying to locate the source of the discomfort.<br/>Feeling the warmth from his hand, Han Li’s consciousness was finally pulled back to reality.<br/>He raised his eyes to look at Shen Kong, who was squatting not far in front of him, feeling a bit dazed for a moment. He hadn’t noticed before… Cheng Chen’s hair color was a light chestnut brown. It was like being coated with a layer of faint gold under the lamp light, softly framing his face like the fur of some small animal. It looked so soft that it made Han Li a little curious about how it would really feel.<br/>The light above casted a warm yellow halo. The young man in front of him lowered his eyes, his long eyelashes casting shadows on his fair cheeks. They trembled gently with each blink, like the wings of a butterfly fluttering to take flight. <br/>Han Li once again fell into deep self-doubt.<br/>Just now…<br/>Was it an illusion?<br/>Shen Kong didn’t find any signs of damage, but he also had no intention of continuing. He got up from the ground, opened the refrigerator door, and took out two cans of ice-cold beer. <br/>He tossed one can to Han Li.<br/>Han Li, still in a daze, subconsciously caught it. The icy metal shell of the beer can chilled his hand, instantly bringing him back from his thoughts.<br/>He looked up at Shen Kong and saw that the other person had already pulled up a chair and sat under the window.<br/>He was now lazily slumped on the chair, tilting his head back and pouring the drink into his mouth, completely devoid of the danger from before. <br/>Han Li hesitated for a moment, then reached out and pulled the ring of the beer can. Snow-white foam instantly gushed out from the narrow opening, catching him off guard and drenching him all over his body and hands.<br/>Shen Kong let out a nasty laugh, taking pleasure in others’ misfortune like a mischievous imp who had successfully pulled off a prank.<br/><br/>Han Li somewhat helplessly got up from the ground. He pulled tissues from the box on the table and wiped his clothes and pants.<br/>He looked at Shen Kong who was laughing happily, his lips involuntarily curving upward. <br/>Han Li’s other hand still clenched the cold beer can. His palm, chilled to the point of hurting, was covered with water droplets condensed on the metal surface. They slowly overflowed from between his fingers, and the chilling sensation seeped into his palm, making his heart ache slightly.<br/>A very strange feeling, but not unpleasant.<br/>The two quietly drank and finished their cans of beer.<br/>Shen Kong exerted a slight force in his palms to flatten the empty beer can, making a crisp, grating sound. He turned to look at Han Li: <br/>“It’s getting late, you should go.”<br/>With that said, he got up from the chair and walked to the sofa. He picked up the schoolbag he had thrown on it and stuffed it into Han Li’s hand, flashing a kind smile: “Oh, by the way, don’t forget to do the homework.”<br/>A minute later, Han Li stood somewhat dazed in the narrow, dark corridor, turning his head to look at the still-open door.<br/>Shen Kong held the door with one hand and stood against the light, the warm yellow light streaming in from behind him. Han Li couldn’t make out his features clearly, only seeing his blurry silhouette. <br/>Even his voice seemed to come from a distant place, deep and unreal:<br/>“I hope you’ve learned enough this time. After all, I didn’t go hard on you this time, but others might not be so lenient.”<br/>After dropping this seemingly meaningful remark, Shen Kong released his grip on the door, allowing it to close shut with the inertia.<br/>“Click.” <br/>The lock fell into place.<br/>The silhouette of the young man, along with the warm yellow light, disappeared behind the door, leaving Han Li standing alone in the dark and chilly corridor. He stared thoughtfully at the now tightly closed door. Then, he slung the backpack over his shoulder and turned to walk downstairs.<br/>Just as the door closed, the system’s voice rang in Shen Kong’s ears like an urgent reminder:<br/>“It has been detected that the rectifier’s actions are not beneficial to the rectification of the task target’s three views. Rectifier, please refrain from acting recklessly!” <br/>Shen Kong had developed patience for the system’s monotonous and dry metallic voice by now. He threw himself into the sofa and lazily replied in his mind:<br/>“Didn’t I say before that since you don’t want me to slack in my work, you must agree with my educational methods.”<br/>Story translated by Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>He took out a cigarette, held it to his lips, and lowered his head to light it.<br/>The system’s voice remained as usual: “The target character is the villain in this book. Transmitting a cruel and ruthless style of behavior to him is not beneficial to the task’s completion. If the task cannot be completed, the rectifier’s points will be reset. You…” <br/>“Enough.”<br/>Shen Kong did not reply in his mind this time, but spoke directly.<br/>His voice was light and faint, as soft as the smoke dissipating in the air, but it seemed to contain some kind of deafening and terrifying coldness:<br/>“When will you understand that my willingness to cooperate is just because I wanted to.” <br/>He flicked off the ash from his cigarette. His light-colored eyes were half-closed, his eyes as silent as the wilderness, glowing with inorganic indifference under the light.<br/>“So many people in the world have this so-called rectified three views and overflowing compassion, yet you guys persistently chose me—an outlaw who’s a million miles away from your purpose. I don’t want to delve into the hidden reasons behind it, nor do I care to understand what went wrong in this so-called book world to make you resort to such desperate measures, forcing me to complete the task.”<br/>Shen Kong leaned back on the sofa and crossed his legs:<br/>“I’m an extreme hedonist. I enjoy all sorts of exciting and interesting things, so I’m willing to take on this loss-making task from you, not because I’m afraid of death—if I cared so much about my life, I would’ve retired long ago, understand?” <br/>He casually flicked off the ash from his cigarette:<br/>“So—I hope this is the last time you threaten me.”</div>
