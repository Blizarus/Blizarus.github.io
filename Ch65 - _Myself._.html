    <div class='content'>As soon as the voice fell, Shen Kong felt a dizzying whirl.<br/>This experience was entirely unlike the previous transmissions. It felt as if every cell in his body was being compressed and squeezed. As if his bones, muscles, and blood were crushed by gravity, then stretched and relaxed again. The intense pain exceeded the limits of human endurance, making it almost unbearable. Every second seemed to stretch into an eternity of torment, yet it also felt like it ended in an instant. <br/>Shen Kong found his feet touching solid ground. Then his knees buckled, nearly causing him to collapse.<br/>Luckily, he managed to catch himself on a nearby wall and barely held himself upright.
<br/>Chrysanthemum Garden.<br/>After several long minutes, the pain seeping from the depths of his bones and muscles finally dissipated. Shen Kong took a deep breath and glanced down at himself.<br/>His dirty jeans were tucked into mud-splattered boots. His loose, short-sleeved shirt was also stained with mud and dried blood. They were so intermixed that it was hard to distinguish one from the other. A short, sharp dagger was tucked into his boot. The gun at his waist was empty. He looked utterly disheveled and defeated. <br/>Yet, it was indeed his own body.

<br/>It felt as though he had finally slipped into the right shell. The comfort from body to soul was almost indescribable.<br/>Shen Kong straightened his back. His long-confined muscles and bones made creaking sounds, like a long-unused and rusted weapon. His long limbs were full of explosive power, as if every inch of skin concealed incredible strength.<br/>Finally…

 <br/>He squinted his eyes in pleasure.<br/>At that moment, the system’s familiar voice sounded in his ears. But strangely, unlike the usual flat mechanical tone, it now sounded somewhat blurred, as if coming from a very distant place. Upon closer listening, there was a faint crackling of static noise.<br/>“Rectifier 0823… zz… are you okay?”

<br/>Shen Kong raised an eyebrow subtly. “I’m fine. What? You can’t monitor it?” <br/>“Zz… there was an unusual fluctuation in the sub-world just now. The studio’s control over the sub-world has weakened, and real-time monitoring is affected… zz…”<br/>So, the connection between the studio and the world of the book has weakened.<br/>Shen Kong furrowed his brows, recalling the huge screen with those lines of various colors that suddenly started trembling, followed by the piercing alarm that echoed throughout the space. A sense of foreboding flashed through his mind, especially when he thought of the blue line symbolizing the target character’s psychological state, which was plummeting toward extreme pathology.<br/>…Could this have something to do with Han Li? <br/>The more he thought about it, the more uneasy he felt. At that moment, the system’s voice sounded again in his ears. Whatever method it used, the voice was much more stable than before. The strange static noise had almost disappeared. “You have now been transmitted to the vicinity of the area where the fluctuations originated.”<br/>Shen Kong looked around and found himself standing in a lush garden. The meticulously trimmed trees and shrubs were arranged alternately with great care, neither too dense nor too sparse. A cobblestone path wound its way into the depths of the garden. The sky was caught between dusk and night. The dim light blurred the swaying branches and the edges of distant, tall buildings in the gentle breehe. The boundary between day and night became unclear. The dark blue sky overhead gradually deepened as time passed, transitioning into the color of late night. Through the gaps in the overlapping branches, bright lights could be seen not far away.<br/>Faint sounds of conversation, laughter, and intermittent music drifted from that direction.<br/>It seemed a banquet was being held. <br/>Shen Kong took a few steps in that direction but suddenly stopped.<br/>He heard the faint rustling of the night breeze brushing through the foliage behind him.<br/>Read more BL at chrysanthemumgarden (dot) com<br/>He narrowed his eyes slightly. His lead-gray irises tightened, like a sharp and alert predator lurking in the darkness. He hunched his back slightly and concealed himself in the shadows of the nearby bushes, blending almost seamlessly with the darkness.<br/>Half a minute later. <br/>A shadowy figure appeared where Shen Kong had just been standing. The figure’s well-trained movements made almost no sound as they glided along the edge of the path like a shadow. At that moment, another shadow sprang from the bushes and swiftly pulled the person into the foliage. In an instant, the attacker seized the person’s throat, twisted, and squeezed, causing them to lose consciousness almost immediately.<br/>Shen Kong slowly released his grip and silently laid the person on the ground.<br/>He quickly inspected the person’s equipment and frowned.<br/>It was an extremely efficient setup: the gun barrel was coated with a special paint to prevent reflections, the grip was treated to avoid leaving fingerprints, and the gun’s model number was filed off to prevent tracing. Coupled with the person’s skilled tactical movements and instinctive struggle during the attack, the conclusion was obvious: this was a highly professional mercenary. And it was definitely not a one-man operation. <br/>Shen Kong took the concealed earpiece from the person and put it in his own ear. The instructions came through clearly amid the static:<br/>“Sniper in position, target confirmed on the second floor.”<br/>He straightened up and looked towards the only illuminated window on the second floor. Though the distance prevented him from seeing inside clearly, he could still identify the best angles and positions for sniping based on the window’s orientation—there were at least two snipers.<br/>Generally speaking, in assassination missions, snipers rarely aim directly at the target indoors due to the difficulty of positioning with numerous obstructions. Additionally, the widespread use of bulletproof glass makes it challenging to secure a clean shot. If the first shot fails, it would only increase the target’s alertness, making further approaches nearly impossible. Hence, snipers are typically a secondary measure, activated if the assault team encounters issues or the target unexpectedly becomes exposed. <br/>This implied that… there was a mercenary group of at least three to five people operating within a hundred-meter radius.<br/>Shen Kong hid the unconscious person in the bushes and took their weapon and communicator. Then he quickly crouched and ran towards the side of the building. Using his experience, he found the door to the fire escape. It was unlocked. The surveillance camera mounted above it had been disabled, indicating that someone had already entered before him.<br/>The fire escape was dimly lit, with the emergency exit sign flickering green. The sounds of laughter, clinking glasses, and soft music filtered through the walls, creating the impression of a thin barrier separating him from the lively world on the other side.<br/>The door was suddenly pushed open. <br/>The “barrier” was broken.<br/>Noisy laughter and chatter poured in. Shen Kong quickly moved into a blind spot in the stairwell and watched as two people walked past him, oblivious to his presence. Snatches of their conversation reached his ears, allowing him to piece together a rough image of the setting.<br/>It seemed to be a private business gathering, with many important family figures in attendance.<br/>In their conversation, Shen Kong heard Han Li’s name. <br/>Though mentioned only once or twice, the tone of reverence and fear in their voices was unmistakable.<br/>After the two left, he swiftly ascended the stairs.<br/><br/>In the hallway on the second floor, Shen Kong could hear deliberately muted footsteps. He knocked out one of the lookouts at the stairwell, but two others ahead were already prepared to enter. Their guns were raised, ready to break down the closed door at any moment. Shen Kong, with a steely expression, used the slumped body as cover and slowly raised his gun, taking aim.<br/>“Bang!” <br/>The door was forced open.<br/>Almost simultaneously, two muffled thuds echoed in the quiet hallway, barely causing a stir thanks to the suppressors.<br/>The two men threw themselves to the ground one after another.<br/>Shen Kong lowered his gun and straightened up. <br/>The barrel of the gun was still slightly warm, like a smoldering ember that seemed to burn from his fingers up his arm and into his heart.<br/>He narrowed his eyes slightly, exhaled, and a faint, almost mocking smile tugged at the corners of his lips, like a bloodthirsty specter.<br/>——Having not been active for a while, he felt a bit rusty.<br/>Shen Kong thought nonchalantly. <br/>At that moment, the earpiece crackled to life again: “Group A down, Group B move in, snipers on alert.”<br/>There was a second wave.<br/>Shen Kong’s nerves tensed again. He dragged the unconscious body at his feet into the stairwell and wedged the man’s weapon into the door to slow the others down. Through the fire escape door, he could hear the disciplined footsteps resuming in the stairwell. Behind him, faint sounds indicated an attempt to breach from another direction.<br/>Now that he was surrounded from both sides, Shen Kong knew he had to secure the target before making any further decisions. <br/>Without hesitation, Shen Kong sprinted towards the door that had just been forced open——<br/>As he reached the doorway, the sound of the fire escape door being kicked open rang out. Shen Kong swiftly rolled to the ground, dodging the incoming bullets, then locked the door behind him in one fluid motion.<br/>From the other end of the room came the sound of a chair being pulled back, followed by slow, deliberate footsteps and the sharp tap of a cane.<br/>Shen Kong spun around abruptly. <br/>Han Li stood not far behind him, his pitch-black eyes watching with an unreadable expression. His features were more mature than when they had last met, with a restrained and suppressed demeanor that was impossible to fathom, like a sword sheathed in a heavy scabbard. The youthful sharpness had been replaced by an impenetrable abyss, equally dangerous and profound.<br/>——Indeed, who else could remain so composed after their door was kicked open and the intruders were suddenly shot to death?<br/><br/>In his earpiece, a clear command came through: “Sniper has a clear sight, ready——”<br/>Shen Kong’s eyes narrowed. He turned and tackled Han Li to the ground. A muffled thud indicated the glass nearby had been hit, but it didn’t shatter. <br/>Bulletproof, thankfully.<br/>Shen Kong looked down at Han Li, who was pinned beneath him, and raised an eyebrow. “How many enemies have you made? Who wants you dead so badly?”<br/>Han Li slowly curled his lips into a smile. He raised his hand and gripped Shen Kong’s arm, gradually tightening his hold. His voice remained calm and indifferent, as if stating an inconsequential fact:<br/>“Myself.” </div>
